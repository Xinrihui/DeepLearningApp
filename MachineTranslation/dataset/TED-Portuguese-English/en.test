by the end of this year , there 'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
the one thing that all of them have in common is that they 're going to die .
while that might be a somewhat morbid thought , i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
what first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by derek k. miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
and what miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
here 's what he wrote in starting that out .
`` he said , `` '' here it is . i 'm dead , and this is my last post to my blog . ''
`` in advance , i asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message i wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . '' '' now , while as a journalist , miller 's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that 's something completely different than anything that 's been created by any previous generation . ''
consider a few stats for a moment .
right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to youtube every single minute .
there are 200 million tweets being posted every day .
and the average facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
so when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
but today we 're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that 's going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we 're gone .
and i think that 's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
now to be clear , i 'm a journalist and not a technologist , so what i 'd like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
now we 're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
one of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when i checked into a deli at a restaurant in new york on foursquare .
( recording ) adam ostrow : hello .
death : adam ?
ao : yeah .
death : death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the organic .
ao : who is this ?
death : go to ifidie.net before it 's too late .
( laughter ) adam ostrow : kind of creepy , right ?
so what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to facebook after you die .
another service right now is called 1,000 memories .
and what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
but what i think comes next is far more interesting .
now a lot of you are probably familiar with deb roy who , back in march , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
i think as machines ' ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it 's going to become possible to analyze an entire life 's worth of content — the tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts — that we 're producing in such massive numbers .
and i think as that happens , it 's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we 're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we 're creating and technology 's ability to make sense of it all .
now we 're already starting to see some experiments here .
one service called my next tweet analyzes your entire twitter stream , everything you 've posted onto twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
you can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
taking it a step further , mit 's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
but what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the united states , where cnn beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with anderson cooper .
what if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
i think that 's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we 're producing and technology 's ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
now in closing , i think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
thank you very much .
( applause )
people tell you this one thing — will make your life complete .
`` then one day you wake up , and they tell you `` '' you 're a queen , '' '' but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings . ''
everyone is crowding 'round when fortune is your friend .
rollercoaster , carousel .
well , maybe i 'm just cynical , and all these words are lies , but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise .
but caution makes you hesitate , and hesitate you 're lost , so take your opportunities and never count the cost .
where the highs are heaven , but the lows , oh , they can be hell .
carousel , carousel , carousel , carousel .
thank you so much .
people returning to work after a career break : i call them relaunchers .
now , successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field .
supreme court justice sandra day o'connor took a five-year career break early in her career .
she was looking for a finance or accounting role , and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results .
the first thing i told tracy was she had to get out of the house .
i told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
expect that , and do n't be discouraged by it .
and that is , that people 's view of you is frozen in time .
or here i am in the kitchen .
but those people from the past , they do n't know about any of this .
there 's one more thing i remember vividly from my own career break .
and that was that i hardly kept up with the business news .
my background is in finance , and i hardly kept up with any news when i was home caring for my four young children .
i believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce , and here 's why .
think about our life stage : for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons , we have fewer or no maternity leaves .
we have fewer spousal or partner job relocations .
we 're in a more settled time of life .
we 're not trying to find ourselves at an employer 's expense .
i found powerpoint much more challenging , but now i use powerpoint all the time .
and if they 're not up to speed , then it 's their responsibility to get there .
i tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break .
it 's the relauncher 's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value .
back in 2010 i started noticing something .
i had been tracking return to work programs since 2008 , and in 2010 , i started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity , whether it was called an internship or not , but an internship-like experience , as a way for professionals to return to work .
i saw goldman sachs and sara lee start corporate reentry internship programs .
i saw a returning engineer , a nontraditional reentry candidate , apply for an entry-level internship program in the military , and then get a permanent job afterward .
i saw two universities integrate internships into mid-career executive education programs .
and now , seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the society of women engineers .
now , why are companies embracing the reentry internship ?
this testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires .
think about how far we have come .
and there 's no reason why there ca n't be a retiree internship program .
different pool , same concept .
so let me tell you what happened with tracy shapiro .
this was in the fall of 2011 .
tracy loved this company , and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house .
tracy 's temp job was a tryout , just like an internship , and it ended up being a win for both tracy and her employer .
now , my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers .
but in the meantime , if you are returning to work after a career break , do n't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program .
be their first success story , and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come .
thank you .
( applause )
today i 'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
it 's just a quick video of what we do .
huh . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
( laughter ) we 'll just — we can just skip — i 'll just skip through the video instead ... ( laughter )
no . ( laughter ) ( laughter )
( music ) this is not ... ( laughter )
okay . ( laughter )
solar technology is ...
oh , that 's all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
( applause )
it was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
i was working at the aclu as the organization 's science advisor .
i explained to chris that i was feeling a little bit stuck .
`` `` yes , you know , patents on human genes . '' ''
and 20 minutes later , he came bursting in my office .
( laughter ) now chris is a really brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics .
i knew something about genetics , but i was n't even a lawyer , let alone a patent lawyer .
`` gene patents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial of these are to so-called `` '' isolated dna '' '' — namely , a piece of dna that has been removed from a cell . ''
so what does that mean ?
gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients .
but was there a way we could challenge them ?
you ca n't patent products of nature — the air , the water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
and you ca n't patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , e = mc2 .
most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy , and , at least in theory , as a matter of law .
why is that ?
there were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
`` now , neither chris nor i were the type to shy away from a challenge , and hearing , `` '' being right just is n't enough , '' '' seemed all the more reason to take on this fight . ''
so we set out to build our case .
now , patent cases tend to be : company a sues company b over some really narrow , obscure technical issue .
myriad held patents on two genes , the brca1 and the brca2 genes .
myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on brca testing in the united states .
it had forced multiple labs that were offering brca testing to stop .
this is kathleen maxian .
the test was negative .
the family was relieved .
had eileen received the proper result , kathleen would have then been tested , and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented .
one of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science .
so in order to argue that what myriad did was not an invention , and that isolated brca genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like : what 's a gene ? what 's dna ?
and we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors , like gold .
we filed in federal court in the southern district of new york , and the case was randomly assigned to judge robert sweet .
i mean , our brief — it was pretty good , but not this good .
how did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time ?
and here things got really interesting .
first , in a pivotal moment of this case , the us government switched sides .
so in the district court the government submitted a brief on myriad 's side .
sort of .
ends up split decision , 2 to 1 .
so now we sought review by the supreme court .
and when you petition the supreme court , you have to present a question that you want the court to answer .
we submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
four words : are human genes patentable ?
i was clearly more nervous than he was .
the argument itself was riveting .
chris argued brilliantly .
justice roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
`` `` '' a naturally occurring dna segment is a product of nature , and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated . ''
but of course the decision goes far beyond myriad .
a few weeks after the court issued its decision , i received a small package in the mail .
i opened it up to find a small stuffed animal .
the process took nearly eight years from the start to finish , with many twists and turns along the way .
thank you .
the second quote is from the head of the uk financial services authority .
unfortunately , the answer is yes .
then , predictions can be made and tested .
so what do we know about complex systems ?
so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
where are economic networks ?
what we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
how are they organized ? are they isolated ?
these are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 .
let me explain by giving you this analogy .
ok , so today i want to talk about how we talk about love .
falling is accidental , it 's uncontrollable .
it 's something that happens to us without our consent .
i am a writer and i 'm also an english teacher , which means i think about words for a living .
so , in love , we fall .
we 're struck .
we swoon .
we burn with passion .
love makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
our hearts ache , and then they break .
so our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness .
in the book of exodus alone , there are 16 references to smiting , which is the word that the bible uses for the vengeance of an angry god .
( laughter ) here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts . ( laughter )
right ?
so , how did this happen ?
and why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims ?
these are difficult questions , but i have some theories .
when i first started researching romantic love , i found these madness metaphors everywhere .
the history of western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness .
these are just a few examples .
i fell in love for the first time when i was 20 , and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start .
and it was long distance for the first couple of years , so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows .
i can remember one moment in particular .
i was sitting on a bed in a hostel in south america , and i was watching the person i love walk out the door .
while i can no longer remember what that argument was about , i very clearly remember how i felt watching him leave .
i had no guidebook and very little money , and i spoke no spanish .
someone more adventurous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but i just froze .
i just sat there .
and then i burst into tears .
`` but despite my panic , some small voice in my head thought , `` '' wow . that was dramatic . ''
i think on some level i wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because i thought that that was how loved worked .
`` this really should not be surprising , considering that according to wikipedia , there are eight films , 14 songs , two albums and one novel with the title `` '' crazy love . '' '' about half an hour later , he came back to our room . ''
we made up .
but i suspect this experience of love is not that unusual .
most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love .
this is true .
so there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors .
and there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way .
researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain .
and most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
but the good news is , it does n't always last that long — usually from a few months to a couple of years .
i decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction , then i did not need their friendship .
and it was probably the most unhappy year of my life .
but i think i felt like it was my job to be miserable , because if i could be miserable , then i would prove how much i loved him .
and if i could prove it , then we would have to end up together eventually .
this is the real madness , because there is no cosmic rule that says that great suffering equals great reward , but we talk about love as if this is true .
our experiences of love are both biological and cultural .
our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain , and it tells us that love is painful when , after a fight or a breakup , that neurochemical reward is withdrawn .
it 's kind of an interesting feedback loop .
love is powerful and at times painful , and we express this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful .
what 's interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy .
it seems like we want it both ways : we want love to feel like madness , and we want it to last an entire lifetime .
that sounds terrible .
so , imagine if we were all less passive in love .
if we were more assertive , more open-minded , more generous and instead of falling in love , we stepped into love .
i know that this is asking a lot , but i 'm not actually the first person to suggest this .
`` in their book , `` '' metaphors we live by , '' '' linguists mark johnson and george lakoff suggest a really interesting solution to this dilemma , which is to change our metaphors . ''
they argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a guide for future actions , like self-fulfilling prophecies .
johnson and lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love : love as a collaborative work of art .
i really like this way of thinking about love .
linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments , which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of , or ideas contained within , a given metaphor .
and johnson and lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails : effort , compromise , patience , shared goals .
these ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long-term romantic commitment , but they also work well for other kinds of relationships — short-term , casual , polyamorous , non-monogamous , asexual — because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone .
so if love is a collaborative work of art , then love is an aesthetic experience .
love is unpredictable , love is creative , love requires communication and discipline , it is frustrating and emotionally demanding .
and love involves both joy and pain .
ultimately , each experience of love is different .
when 14-year-old juliet first meets — or , when 14-year-old juliet can not be with romeo , whom she has met four days ago , she does not feel disappointed or angsty .
where is she ?
right ?
he 's alive , he 's healthy , he 's just been banished from the city .
i understand that 16th-century verona is unlike contemporary north america , and yet when i first read this play , also at age 14 , juliet 's suffering made sense to me .
reframing love as something i get to create with someone i admire , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent , is empowering .
it 's still hard .
this is n't easy , either .
but it 's just so much better than the alternative , which is that thing that feels like madness .
this version of love is not about winning or losing someone 's affection .
instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolutionary , radical act .
this is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you 're gaining or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
`` this version of love allows us to say things like , `` hey , we 're not very good collaborators . maybe this is n't for us . '' ''
`` or , `` '' that relationship was shorter than i had planned , but it was still kind of beautiful . '' '' the beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself . ''
this version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
thank you .
( applause )
or here .
but here .
i mean earth .
and it 's happening during our lifetimes .
so let me just mount some drives . go over there .
what we have here is one exploit file .
well , basically the east was swallowed by the west .
know that china believes in the market and the state .
our thinking is backwards .
we should be celebrating play .
but before i give it away , i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you 're doing with your body .
we make ourselves small .
i notice a couple of things about this .
they actually feel they 're going to win even at games of chance .
here are a couple more .
here 's what we find on testosterone .
i am an impostor .
like , she can fake it , she can become it .
tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
so , this is two minutes .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
this is a time of need .
strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
beau lotto : so , this game is very simple .
all you have to do is read what you see . right ?
so , i 'm going to count to you , so we do n't all do it together .
okay , one , two , three.audience : can you read this ?
bl : amazing . what about this one ? one , two , three.audience : you are not reading this .
bl : all right . one , two , three . ( laughter ) if you were portuguese , right ? how about this one ? one , two , three .
audience : what are you reading ?
bl : what are you reading ? there are no words there .
i said , read what you 're seeing . right ?
`` it literally says , `` '' wat ar ou rea in ? '' '' ( laughter ) right ? ''
that 's what you should have said . right ? why is this ?
it 's because perception is grounded in our experience .
right ? the brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what 's there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
all right ? which means , when it comes to perception , we 're all like this frog .
( laughter ) right ? it 's getting information . it 's generating behavior that 's useful . ( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( video ) man : ow ! ow ! ( laughter ) ( applause ) bl : and sometimes , when things do n't go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right ?
but we 're talking about perception here , right ?
and perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we 're only ever responding according to what we 've done before .
but actually , it 's a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
now , i want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
they begin with a question .
the problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . it 's evolutionarily a bad thing . if you 're not sure that 's a predator , it 's too late .
okay ? ( laughter ) even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you 're moving . your eyes , because it 's moving in register with the boat , say i 'm standing still .
your brain can not deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
`` the question `` '' why ? '' '' is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty . ''
and yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
so how can we ever do anything new ? well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
and it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . the best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
they 're the ones that question the things we think to be true already . right ?
it 's easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
so what is evolution 's answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
it 's play .
now play is not simply a process . experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being .
play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . uncertainty is what makes play fun .
right ? it 's adaptable to change . right ? it opens possibility , and it 's cooperative . it 's actually how we do our social bonding , and it 's intrinsically motivated . what that means is that we play to play . play is its own reward .
now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
it 's actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
so if you add rules to play , you have a game .
that 's actually what an experiment is .
so armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
and who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children ?
because they 're experts in play . so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . right ?
the first step was to ask a question .
now , i should say that we did n't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children could n't make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids could n't do it .
so we did it anyway . right ? of course .
so , here are some of the questions . i put them in small print so you would n't bother reading it . point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . right ?
so they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
she was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she 's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . right ? she will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at ted . right ?
now , science and asking questions is about courage .
now she is the personification of courage , because she 's going to stand up here and talk to you all .
so amy , would you please come up ? ( applause ) ( applause ) so amy 's going to help me tell the story of what we call the blackawton bees project , and first she 's going to tell you the question that they came up with . so go ahead , amy .
amy o'toole : thank you , beau . we thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
but we wondered if there 's a possible link with other animals . it 'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
so we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . so what if bees can think like us ?
well , it 'd be amazing , since we 're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
but it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( applause ) bl : so the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . so the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
ao : the puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
we asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it 's in a certain pattern .
they were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
now there 's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . the interesting question is , which ?
what was really exciting about this project was we , and beau , had no idea whether it would work .
it was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( laughter ) bl : including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
it 's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he 's doing , because that 's what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what 's going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to dave strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . okay ?
so i 'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . so here are some of the students doing the observations . they 're recording the data of where the bees fly .
( video ) dave strudwick : so what we 're going to do —student : 5c .
dave strudwick : is she still going up here ? student : yeah .
dave strudwick : so you keep track of each.student : henry , can you help me here ?
`` bl : `` '' can you help me , henry ? '' '' what good scientist says that , right ? ''
student : there 's two up there .
and three in here .
bl : right ? so we 've got our observations . we 've got our data .
they do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc. , etc .
and now we want to share . that 's the next step .
so we 're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . right ? so we have to write it up .
so we go , of course , to the pub . all right ? ( laughter ) the one on the left is mine , okay ? ( laughter ) now , i tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
the introduction says , what 's the question and why ?
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
and the discussion is , who cares ? right ?
that 's a science paper , basically . ( laughter ) so the kids give me the words , right ? i put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
`` it 's not written by me . it 's written by amy and the other students in the class . as a consequence , this science paper begins , `` '' once upon a time ... `` '' ( laughter ) the results section , it says : `` '' training phase , the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh . '' '' right ? ( laughter ) and the methods , it says , `` '' then we put the bees into the fridge ( and made bee pie ) , '' '' smiley face . right ? ( laughter ) this is a science paper . we 're going to try to get it published . ''
so here 's the title page . we have a number of authors there .
all the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
`` the first author is blackawton primary school , because if it were ever referenced , it would be `` '' blackawton et al , '' '' and not one individual . so we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . it said many things , but it said this . ''
`` `` '' i 'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . '' '' ( laughter ) in other words , it starts off `` '' once upon a time , '' '' the figures are in crayon , etc . ( laughter ) so we said , we 'll get it reviewed . so i sent it to dale purves , who is at the national academy of science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , `` '' this is the most original science paper i have ever read '' '' — ( laughter ) — `` and it certainly deserves wide exposure . '' ''
`` larry maloney , expert in vision , says , `` '' the paper is magnificent . ''
`` the work would be publishable if done by adults . '' '' so what did we do ? we send it back to the editor . ''
they say no .
so we asked larry and natalie hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to biology letters .
and there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . okay ? ( applause ) ( applause ) it took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( laughter ) typical science , actually , right ? so this makes amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
what was the feedback like ?
well , it was published two days before christmas , downloaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
it was the editors ' choice in science , which is a top science magazine .
it 's forever freely accessible by biology letters .
it 's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
last year , it was the second-most downloaded paper by biology letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
and i 'll just read one .
`` `` '' i have read 'blackawton bees ' recently . i do n't have words to explain exactly how i am feeling right now . ''
what you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
who else can have these qualities more than children ?
`` please congratulate your children 's team from my side . '' '' so i 'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor . ''
can i do it on you ? ( laughter ) oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . yeah yeah . okay .
now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( laughter ) for me , not for him . right ? because we 've only done this once before . ( laughter ) and you like technology , right ?
shimon schocken : right , but i like myself .
bl : this is the epitome of technology . right . okay .
now ... ( laughter ) okay . ( laughter ) now , we 're going to do a little demonstration , right ?
you have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . all right ?
( clapping ) ( clapping ) okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . one , two , three ?
audience : ( shouts ) ( laughter ) ( shouts ) ( laughter ) brilliant . now , open your eyes . we 'll do it one more time .
everyone over there shout . ( shouts ) where 's the sound coming from ? ( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause ) what 's the point ? the point is what science does for us .
right ? we normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . when he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
that 's what science offers us . it offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
now , true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so i 've asked amy to be the last voice in this short story .
so , amy ?
ao : this project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and i mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . it all depends on the way the person feels about change .
but changing the way i thought about science was surprisingly easy . once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , i then realized that science is n't just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
you just need an opportunity . my opportunity came in the form of beau , and the blackawton bee project .
thank you.bl : thank you very much . ( applause ) ( applause )
and then you ask , why economists ?
of course , you can also see it on the website , and we 'll also talk about it more , i 'm sure , as the day goes on .
it would do a lot of good , but it 's also very , very costly .
`` we have , you know , `` '' the day after tomorrow '' '' — it looks great , right ? ''
the year is 1800 .
a curious little invention is being talked about .
it 's called a microscope .
what it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
we still have this monster soup around , and it 's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
now it 's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
you take a stain , like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or giemsa , and a microscope , and you look at them .
they all have faces .
why is that so , that alex in kenya , fatima in bangladesh , navjoot in mumbai , and julie and mary in uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick ?
and that 's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
and remember that number : one billion .
the problem lies with the microscope itself .
even though the pinnacle of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field testing .
neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
they are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
this picture is mahatma gandhi in the '40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing t.b . in his ashram in sevagram in india .
two of my students , jim and james , traveled around india and thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
we saw all kinds of donated equipment .
we saw fungus growing on microscope lenses .
and we saw people who had a functional microscope but just did n't know how to even turn it on .
what grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call foldscopes .
so what is a foldscope ?
a foldscope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , bright-field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
so , now you think , how is that possible ?
i 'm going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
it starts with a single sheet of paper .
what you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope .
so , there are three stages : there is the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage .
and there are micro optics at the bottom that 's actually embedded in the paper itself .
what you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a toy , which it is , i tab it off , and i break it off .
this paper has no instructions and no languages .
there is a code , a color code embedded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
when it 's done , it looks something like this , has all the functionalities of a standard microscope , just like an xy stage , a place where a sample slide could go , for example right here .
we did n't want to change this , because this is the standard that 's been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
so this is what changes , but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases .
you pop this in .
there is an xy stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flexure mechanism that 's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps .
so what 's really interesting about this object , and my students hate when i do this , but i 'm going to do this anyway , is these are rugged devices .
i can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it .
and they last , even though they 're designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
and i 'm going to pick one randomly .
this one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria .
so the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this .
so up till now , you did n't actually see what i would see from one of these setups .
so what i would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes .
i have these two microscopes that i 'm going to turn — go to the back of the wall — and just project , and this way you will see exactly what i would see .
what you 're looking at — ( applause ) — this is a cross-section of a compound eye , and when i 'm going to zoom in closer , right there , i am going through the z-axis .
you actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern .
another example , one of my favorite insects , i love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you 're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens .
right there .
all from the simple setup that i actually described .
so my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever i forget them in the dryer .
so it turns out they 're waterproof , and — ( laughter ) — right here is just fluorescent water , and i do n't know if you can actually see this .
this also shows you how the projection scope works .
you get to see the beam the way it 's projected and bent .
can we get the lights back on again ?
i 'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
here is a sheet of paper .
this is when we were thinking about the idea .
this is an a4 sheet of paper .
these are the three stages that you actually see .
and the optical components , if you look at the inset up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs , so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself .
so that 's where the lenses go .
there are some light sources .
and essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment .
so even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
so here is another obvious thing that we would do , typically , if i was going to show that these microscopes are robust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
there it is , and it survives .
so for us , the next step actually is really finishing our field trials .
we are starting at the end of the summer .
we are at a stage where we 'll be making thousands of microscopes .
that would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place .
we 've started collecting data for malaria , chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves .
and i want to leave you with this picture .
i had not anticipated this before , but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health .
what are the tools that we 're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow ?
i would love for them to be able to just print out a foldscope and carry them around in their pockets .
thank you .
( applause )
but at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
pimp my carroça took to the streets of são paulo , rio de janeiro and curitiba .
and from here , we 're able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
because i want to show points of interest .
no , no . the other way .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
ok , never mind .
we 're doing two different things here .
one of them is to take that real ...
i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
( applause )
we get it in the abstract .
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
and the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
i think this is a problem .
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
( laughter ) you 're all cfo , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
okay , so fine .
so this is a huge practical problem .
he told me i 'd be going with him the next morning .
these were the men i looked up to .
so what opened my eyes ?
in that instant , i realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
zak ebrahim is not my real name .
so why would i out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
well , that 's simple .
instead , i choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
i am not my father .
i 'm honored by the invitation , and thanks .
a third time , it 's just being a technician .
my idea is : no ! no !
they know .
so it 's highly — that one 's the cool one .
and it sent me back .
soon after that , i found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
bob 's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
anyone who 's a musician has been profoundly influenced by robert moog .
oh , cool . i can get to this place over here , right ?
i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
and there 's no time to do it .
right ? this is simple physics .
all of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
so anytime i talk , you 'd see it on the screen .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
ok , let 's go back to mr. elmo .
and we 'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
`` it is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . '' '' thank you very much . ''
a few years ago , i broke into my own house .
and as i stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , i found i did n't have my keys .
in fact , i could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where i had left them .
so i quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked tight .
i thought about calling a locksmith — at least i had my cellphone , but at midnight , it could take a while for a locksmith to show up , and it was cold .
now , i 'm a neuroscientist by training and i know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress .
( laughter ) and it was n't until i got to the airport check-in counter , that i realized i did n't have my passport . ( laughter )
well , i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep .
some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
i 'll start with the obvious ones .
around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there 's a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
there 's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
it 's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
but it 's really good for things that do n't move around much , not so good for things that move around .
so this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
so in the home , designate a spot for your keys — a hook by the door , maybe a decorative bowl .
for your passport , a particular drawer .
for your reading glasses , a particular table .
if you designate a spot and you 're scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
what about travel ?
if these things are lost or stolen , you can facilitate replacement .
now these are some rather obvious things .
remember , when you 're under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
and there 's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you 're confronted with a medical decision to make .
and so i want to talk about that .
and i 'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
`` so suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , `` i just got your lab work back , your cholesterol 's a little high . '' ''
now , you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
it 's for the number needed to treat .
now , what is this , the nnt ?
it 's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped .
and you 're thinking , what kind of crazy statistic is that ?
and it 's not the doctor 's fault , if it 's anybody 's fault , it 's the fault of scientists like me .
so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ?
i ran through the numbers myself .
`` now you 're probably thinking , `` '' well , ok , one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol . ''
so for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients .
you 're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
now , i 'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
and the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
they include impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
and if you 're lucky , and you 're one of the 50 percent who has these , they 'll only last for a year or two .
you do n't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
and you also want to think about things like quality of life .
there 's an evolutionary reason for this .
face-to-face with a predator , you do n't need your digestive system , or your libido , or your immune system , because if you 're body is expending metabolism on those things and you do n't react quickly , you might become the lion 's lunch , and then none of those things matter .
unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as danny kahneman and his colleagues have shown .
so we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
i think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
we all are going to fail now and then .
the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
so i 'm not completely organized , but i see organization as a gradual process , and i 'm getting there .
thank you very much .
( applause )
`` so i looked at the waiter and said , `` do you have a menu ( arabic ) ? '' ''
at that moment , i started thinking .
where 's the logic in that ?
the arabic language does n't satisfy today 's needs .
where can i use it , then ? we could all ask this question !
this is one reality .
but we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
how ?
gibran khalil gibran , when he first started writing , he used arabic .
so , when he started writing in english , he had enough baggage .
even when he wrote in english , when you read his writings in english , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
you can imagine that that 's him writing in english , the same boy who came from the mountain . from a village on mount lebanon .
so , this is an example no one can argue with .
this is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
the germans , french , japanese and chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
that 's why they legislate to protect their language .
they make it sacred .
that 's why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
do we know better than them ?
all right , we are n't from the developed world , this advanced thinking has n't reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as turkey , malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
they kept it close to them .
because if you get any product from turkey or elsewhere and it 's not labeled in turkish , then it is n't a local product .
you would n't believe it 's a local product .
they 'd go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
so , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
`` if i say , `` '' freedom , sovereignty , independence ( arabic ) , '' '' what does this remind you of ? ''
it does n't ring a bell , does it ?
regardless of the who , how and why .
language is n't just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
language is n't one , two or three words or letters put together .
what is our intellect ?
how do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
`` so , if i say , `` '' freedom , sovereignty , independence ( english ) , '' '' or if your son came up to you and said , `` dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( english ) slogan ? '' ''
how would you feel ?
if you do n't see a problem , then i 'd better leave , and stop talking in vain .
the idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
i have a francophone friend who 's married to a french man .
i asked her once how things were going .
does she want to commit suicide ?
`` 'bury me ? ' ( english ) '' '' this is one of the few examples . ''
it made us feel that she 's unable to tell that word to her husband , since he wo n't understand , and he 's right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
`` she said to me , `` '' he listens to fairuz with me , and one night , i tried to translate for him so he can feel what i feel when i listen to fairuz . '' '' the poor woman tried to translate this for him : `` from them i extended my hands and stole you — '' ( laughter ) and here 's the pickle : `` and because you belong to them , i returned my hands and left you . '' ( laughter ) ''
translate that for me .
( applause ) so , what have we done to protect the arabic language ?
we turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the arabic language .
`` even though many people told me , `` '' why do you bother ? ''
`` forget about this headache and go have fun . '' '' no problem ! ''
`` the campaign to preserve arabic launched a slogan that says , `` i talk to you from the east , but you reply from the west . '' ''
`` we did n't say , `` '' no ! we do not accept this or that . '' '' we did n't adopt this style because that way , we would n't be understood . ''
and when someone talks to me that way , i hate the arabic language .
in a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
`` so , `` '' i talk to you from the east , but you reply from the west '' '' has hit the spot . ''
something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
after that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
`` you 've seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with `` '' do n't kill your language ! '' '' written on it . ''
why ? seriously , do n't kill your language .
we really should n't kill our language .
if we were to kill the language , we 'd have to find an identity .
we 'd have to find an existence .
we 'd go back to the beginning .
this is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
after that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the arabic letter .
`` photos of `` '' cool '' '' guys and girls . ''
we are very cool !
`` and to whoever might say , `` '' ha ! you used an english word ! '' '' i say , `` '' no ! i adopt the word 'cool . ' '' '' let them object however they want , but give me a word that 's nicer and matches the reality better . ''
`` i will keep on saying `` '' internet '' '' i would n't say : `` '' i 'm going to the world wide web '' '' ( laughs ) because it does n't fit ! we should n't kid ourselves . ''
creativity is the idea .
so , if we ca n't reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
at this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
let 's start from this moment .
it could bring the arabic language back to being number one .
so , it 's not true that there 's no solution ; there is a solution !
but we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
in conclusion , what can you do today ?
now , tweets , who 's tweeting ?
please , i beg of you , even though my time has finished , either arabic , english , french or chinese .
but do n't write arabic with latin characters mixed with numbers !
( applause ) it 's a disaster ! that 's not a language .
you 'd be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
it 's not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
( applause ) let 's get rid of this cultural cringe . ( applause )
the who and the why are what 's important to me .
what 's the context of this meal ?
the point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
this is an easy sell .
forget nuclear holocaust ; it 's the fork that we have to worry about .
it does n't work .
but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
well , if you must , i have a recipe for you .
i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
i remember well the meals of my childhood .
for community though , we start at the very beginning .
there 's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
( applause )
hi . i am an architect .
1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , i just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
it 's very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than i expected , and also it 's very easy to waterproof , and also , because it 's industrial material , it 's also possible to fireproof .
then i built the temporary structure , 1990 .
this is the first temporary building made out of paper .
there are 330 tubes , diameter 55 [ centimeters ] , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
year 2000 , there was a big expo in germany .
i was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
so i was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
my goal of the design is not when it 's completed .
my goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
after , the building was recycled .
so that was the goal of my design .
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz .
we stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you . i had one big problem .
because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
that was the problem .
then i completed the pompidou center in metz .
it 's a very popular museum now , and i created a big monument for the government .
but then i was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
they have money and power .
those are invisible .
so they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
but i must say they are no longer natural disasters .
for example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
that 's the responsibility of architects .
then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
so i thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
we can make it better .
so that is why i started working in disaster areas .
1994 , there was a big disaster in rwanda , africa .
two tribes , hutu and tutsi , fought each other .
over two million people became refugees .
but i was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the u.n .
they 're so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , in the shelters built by the u.n. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
but over two million people cut trees .
that is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
so i proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 u.s. dollars per unit .
we built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
and then , year afterward , 1995 , in kobe , japan , we had a big earthquake .
nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
and also i found out there 's many vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a catholic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
`` so i went there and also i proposed to the priests , `` why do n't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? '' ''
`` and he said , `` '' oh god , are you crazy ? ''
i started commuting to kobe , and i met the society of vietnamese people .
they were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
so i proposed to rebuild . i raised — did fundraising .
i made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , i used beer crates as a foundation .
i asked the kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which does n't go with the color of the paper tubes .
the color coordination is very important .
and also i still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . ( laughter ) so i remember it was so disappointing .
so during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
`` he said , `` '' as long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . '' '' so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church . ''
it was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
then , in taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
it stayed there in taiwan as a permanent church even now .
so this building became a permanent building .
then i wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
in 1999 , in turkey , the big earthquake , i went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
2001 , in west india , i built also a shelter .
in 2004 , in sri lanka , after the sumatra earthquake and tsunami , i rebuilt islamic fishermen 's villages .
and in 2008 , in chengdu , sichuan area in china , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
i was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students .
in one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
it 's still used , even after the current earthquake in china .
in 2009 , in italy , l'aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
and they are very kind , affording my model .
i proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because l'aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
so i proposed to the mayor , i 'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
`` he said , `` '' as long as you bring your money , you can do it . '' '' and i was very lucky . ''
year 2010 in haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it 's impossible to fly over , so i went to santo domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to haiti with the local students in santo domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
this is what happened in japan two years ago , in northern japan .
after the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
but look at this . there 's no privacy .
people suffer mentally and physically .
so we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
however , some of the facility authority does n't want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it 's become more difficult to control them .
but it 's really necessary to do it .
they do n't have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
so i proposed to the mayor while i was making partitions .
finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi .
he asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [ fields ] .
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
many of the people want to stay here forever .
i was very happy to hear that .
now i am working in new zealand , christchurch .
about 20 days before the japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of christchurch , was totally destroyed .
and i was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
so this is under construction .
and i 'd like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
thank you very much .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
what is going on in this baby 's mind ?
if you 'd asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric — that he could n't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
in the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
so in some ways , we think that this baby 's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
let me give you just one example of this .
one thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what 's going on in the mind of that other baby .
after all , one of the things that 's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
and maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel is n't actually exactly like what we think and feel .
anyone who 's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
now the question is : how could we ask them ?
babies , after all , ca n't talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you 'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
so how do we actually ask them the question ?
well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
what we did — betty rapacholi , who was one of my students , and i — was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
now all of the babies , even in berkley , like the crackers and do n't like the raw broccoli .
( laughter ) but then what betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
and she would act as if she liked it or she did n't .
so half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and did n't like the broccoli — just like a baby and any other sane person .
`` but half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , `` '' mmmmm , broccoli . ''
`` i tasted the broccoli . mmmmm . '' '' and then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she 'd go , `` '' eww , yuck , crackers . ''
`` i tasted the crackers . eww , yuck . '' '' so she 'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted . ''
we did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
`` and then she would simply put her hand out and say , `` can you give me some ? '' ''
so the question is : what would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
and the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
on the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they could n't figure this out .
but then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
so there are two really remarkable things about this .
the first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we do n't always want the same thing .
and what 's more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds did n't do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
so children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
and this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that 's actually demonstrated it .
the question you might ask though is : why do children learn so much ?
and how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
i mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
and actually in many ways , they 're worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
but if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there 's actually an answer .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there 's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
and sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
on one side is a new caledonian crow .
and crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
they 're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
and this is a bird on the cover of science who 's learned how to use a tool to get food .
on the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
and chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
so they 're very , very good at pecking for grain , and they 're not much good at doing anything else .
well it turns out that the babies , the new caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
they depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
so childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
there 's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
so they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
other creatures , like the crows , are n't very good at doing anything in particular , but they 're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
and of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
we 're smarter , we 're more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
and our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
my son is 23 .
( laughter ) and at least until they 're 23 , we 're still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
all right , why would we see this correlation ?
well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
and that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you 're going to be helpless .
`` so you do n't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , `` a slingshot or maybe a spear might work . which would actually be better ? '' ''
you want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
and the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
so the idea is that we have this early period when we 're completely protected .
we do n't have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
and then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
so one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
so they 're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we 're production and marketing .
we have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species — kind of like caterpillars and butterflies — except that they 're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we 're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
if this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that 's what they 're for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
and in fact , the baby 's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
but real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
and there 's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
and it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the reverend thomas bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
so what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
they go out and test it against the evidence .
the evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
and that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
and some 10 years ago , i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
so if you want to know what 's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , i think it actually looks something like this .
this is reverend bayes 's notebook .
so i think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they 're revising to figure out how the world works .
all right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
how could it be that children are doing statistics ?
so to test this we used a machine that we have called the blicket detector .
this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
and using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
let me mention just one that we did with tumar kushner , my student .
if i showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
but actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you would n't ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
so the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
it looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
so we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
and sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
they 're just learning how to count .
but unconsciously , they 're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
and the other interesting thing is that they 're using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
and in studies we 've just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we 've show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
so in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
`` when children do experiments we call it `` '' getting into everything '' '' or else `` '' playing . '' '' and there 's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program . ''
here 's one from cristine legare 's lab .
what cristine did was use our blicket detectors .
and what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones did n't , and then she showed them an anomaly .
and what you 'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
( video ) boy : how about this ?
same as the other side .
alison gopnik : okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
( laughter ) boy : this one lighted up , and this one nothing .
ag : okay , he 's got his experimental notebook out .
boy : what 's making this light up .
( laughter ) i do n't know .
ag : every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
( laughter ) boy : oh , it 's because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
ag : okay , hypothesis two .
boy : that 's why .
oh .
( laughter ) ag : now this is his next idea .
he told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
not working either .
boy : oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this does n't have electricity .
ag : okay , that 's a fourth hypothesis .
boy : it 's lighting up .
so when you put four .
so you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
ag : okay , there 's his fifth hypothesis .
now that is a particularly — that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
if you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
this is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
well , what 's it like to be this kind of creature ?
what 's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
and i think just the opposite is true .
i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
now here 's what we know about how adult consciousness works .
and adults ' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
so what happens for adults is we decide that something 's relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
our consciousness of that thing that we 're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
so what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
so we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
if we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
i think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
so babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
but they 're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
and if you actually look in their brains , you see that they 're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts have n't come on yet .
so when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they 're bad at not paying attention .
so they 're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that 's important .
that 's the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , i think the best thing is think about cases where we 're put in a new situation that we 've never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we 're in a new city for the first time .
and what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
and by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you 've been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
so what 's it like to be a baby ?
it 's like being in love in paris for the first time after you 've had three double-espressos .
( laughter ) that 's a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning . ( laughter )
now it 's good to be a grownup .
i do n't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
it 's good to be a grownup .
we can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
and it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
but if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
( applause )
i 'm going to share with you the story as to how i have become an hiv/aids campaigner .
and this is the name of my campaign : sing campaign .
in november of 2003 , i was invited to take part in the launch of nelson mandela 's 46664 foundation — that is his hiv/aids foundation .
and 46664 is the number that mandela had when he was imprisoned in robben island .
and that 's me with youssou n'dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
the next day , all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island , where he was going to give a conference to the world 's press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
you can see the bars of the window there .
it was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
in that moment in time , mandela told the world 's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-apartheid rainbow nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
this was a huge impact on my mind , because i am a woman and i am a mother , and i had n't realized that the hiv/aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
`` and so i committed — when i left south africa , when i left capetown , i told myself , `` '' this is going to be something that i have to talk about . ''
`` i have to serve . '' '' and so , subsequently i participated in every single 46664 event that i could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done . ''
everyone in the world respects nelson mandela , everyone reveres nelson mandela .
but do they all know about what has been taking place in south africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?
i think that if i went out into the street now and i told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
i was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met zackie achmat , the founder of treatment action campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
i met him at a 46664 event .
he was wearing a t-shirt like the one i wear now .
this is a tool — this tells you i am in solidarity with people who have hiv , people who are living with hiv .
`` and in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt i say , `` '' yes , we can talk about this issue . ''
`` it does n't have to be in the closet . '' '' i became a member of treatment action campaign and i 'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization . ''
it 's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are hiv-positive .
they work in the field .
they have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
they have education programs .
they bring out the issues of stigma .
it 's quite extraordinary what they do .
and yes , my sing campaign has supported treatment action campaign in the way that i have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
a lot of the funding that i have managed to raise has gone directly to treatment action campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in south africa .
so this is my sing campaign .
sing campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
i 've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — i went to about 12 different countries .
here i am in oslo in norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in hong kong , trying to get people to raise money .
in johannesburg , i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really do n't quite know what the solutions are .
aaron motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
this is in the scottish parliament .
i 've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv .
and i was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
and once again , in edinburgh with the wonderful african children 's choir who i simply adore .
and it 's children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the aids virus .
i 'm sitting here in new york with michel sidibe — he 's the director of unaids .
and i 'm very honored by the fact that michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a unaids ambassador .
and in this way , i 've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
it 's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
this can happen .
and here i am with a pregnant woman , who is hiv positive and we 're smiling , both of us are smiling , because we 're very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she 's about to give birth to .
and her baby will receive pmtct , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
it 's one way to start looking at intervention with the aids pandemic .
now , i just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about avelile .
this is avelile — she goes with me wherever i go .
i tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of hiv/aids orphans .
avelile 's mother had hiv virus — she died from aids-related illness .
avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
and here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
at this point in her life , she 's suffering with full-blown aids and had pneumonia .
we met her in a hospital in the eastern cape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an adorable child .
the doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
they put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
and we did n't know when we left the hospital — because we filmed her story — we did n't know if she was going to survive .
so , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
five months later , we went back to south africa to meet avelile again .
and i 'm getting — the hairs on my — i do n't know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
they 're standing up because i know what i 'm going to show you .
this is the transformation that took place .
is n't it extraordinary ?
( applause ) that round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of avelile .
and i take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
so , i would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the millennium development goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-saharan africa — could you please stand up .
i think that 's fair to say , it 's almost everyone in the hall .
thank you very much .
( applause )
now we have the good fortune to open up space .
( applause )
good morning . so magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
as a cyber-magician , i combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
you 've probably all heard of google 's project glass .
it 's new technology . you look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
so these are my illusion glasses .
they 're a little bigger . they 're a prototype .
and when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist .
let me show you what i mean .
all we need is a playing card . any card will do .
like this . and let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
all right . very significant mark .
and let 's put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let 's get started .
( music ) voice : system ready . acquiring image .
marco tempest : for those of you who do n't play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
the cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
there 's spring , summer , autumn and â voice : my favorite season is winter.mt : well yeah , mine too .
winter is like magic . it 's a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
there are 13 cards in each suit . ( music ) voice : each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles .
mt : so over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
voice : the moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
mt : there are two colors in a deck of cards .
there is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
voice : marco , i did not know you could do that . ( laughter ) mt : and is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
( music ) voice : if you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
mt : oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
make a wish . ( blowing noise ) voice : do n't tell , or it wo n't come true .
mt : well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that i received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , i have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . ( applause ) voice : and who are these ? mt : ah , mischief-makers . watch .
wake up .
joker : whoa.mt : are you ready for your party piece ?
joker : ready ! mt : let me see what you 've got .
joker : presenting my pogo stick.mt : ah . watch out .
joker : whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! ( music ) mt : but today , i am performing for a different kind of audience .
i 'm performing for you .
voice : signed card detected.mt : well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? is it a 9-to-5 job ?
of course not ! you 've got to practice 24/7 .
i do n't literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . ( laughter ) ( applause ) ( music ) whoa .
well , to this , i just say , no no .
actually , in german , it 's nein nein . ( laughter ) magic is n't that intense . i have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , do n't play for money .
( music ) voice : why not ? that 's a very good hand .
the odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
mt : yeah , but i guess my hand is better . we beat the odds .
voice : i think you got your birthday wish.mt : and that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
and unlike anything else we 've just seen , virtual or not.voice : signed card detected .
digital mt : this is without a question the real thing .
mt : bye bye . ( music ) thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause ) ( applause )
pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
during the four years of conflict that devastated the bosnian nation in the early '90s , approximately 30,000 citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
it is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
genocide is not only about the killing ; it is about the denied identity .
there are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
so i would like to show you something i 've been working on .
so here i 'm going to show you two tandem clips .
the next work is an object , that 's also a kind of sound instrument .
so to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
that would be the plan .
i would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then i would kind of do this .
( laughter ) and that would happen every single paper .
and i knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an option .
this is how the year would go .
how hard could it be to walk up the stairs ?
no big deal , right ?
but then , the funniest thing happened .
and then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
i thought that was the end of everything .
( laughter ) ( applause ) that did not happen . ( laughter )
it was a very , very bad thesis . ( laughter )
`` i just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , `` this guy is amazing ! '' ( laughter ) ''
no , no , it was very , very bad .
anyway , today i 'm a writer-blogger guy .
i write the blog wait but why .
and a couple of years ago , i decided to write about procrastination .
my behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me , and i wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators , and why we are the way we are .
now , i had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people .
i want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
( laughter ) now ...
here 's my brain .
( laughter ) there is a difference .
both brains have a rational decision-maker in them , but the procrastinator 's brain also has an instant gratification monkey .
well , it means everything 's fine until this happens .
after that , we 're going to go on a youtube spiral that starts with videos of richard feynman talking about magnets and ends much , much later with us watching interviews with justin bieber 's mom .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' all of that 's going to take a while , so we 're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today . ''
`` sorry ! '' '' ( sigh ) now , what is going on here ? ''
the instant gratification monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel .
he lives entirely in the present moment .
now , in the animal world , that works fine .
if you 're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you 're a huge success !
but , if you have n't noticed , now we 're not in tribal times .
we can visualize the future .
we can see the big picture .
and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
and that 's when we have a conflict .
i call it the dark playground .
and the question is , in this situation , with the monkey behind the wheel , how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleasant place , but where really important things happen ?
it 's always been a dream of mine to have done a ted talk in the past .
`` he was saying , `` '' are we clear on what we just accepted ? ''
do we get what 's going to be now happening one day in the future ?
as six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of ted decided to release the speakers .
but that 's completely wrong .
nothing personal .
there are inherent benefits to this .
leadership is a choice . it is not a rank .
the most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
as a child , i discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality .
i cherish those memories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barriers , as language or culture .
`` during those trips , my grandmother used to recite a kipling poem : `` '' something hidden . go and find it . ''
go and look behind the mountains .
something lost behind the mountains .
`` lost and waiting for you . go ! '' '' in the coming years , i became a medical student . ''
one of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease .
there 's a part of this problem i think i can solve — the part of this problem i have spent my life working on .
the fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood .
if it does n't close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
it is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions .
but what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
as you can see in the chart , the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude .
to close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
one night , my friend malte , were camping in the amazon region .
the only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch .
then came a moment of inspiration .
so we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
the holes in children 's hearts can be closed with it .
a coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself .
it maybe does n't look so fancy to you now , but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem .
in this video , we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart .
the coil then closes the hole .
after that moment of inspiration , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype .
the coil , if it works , can save lives .
i returned from germany to bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
with my wife and partner , dr. alexandra heath , we started to see patients .
but we live in a place that is 12,000 feet high .
most patients can not afford to be treated on time , and they die .
the search started again .
we went back to the drawing board .
after many trials , and with the help of my grandmother 's indigenous friends in the mountains , we obtained a new device .
it can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop .
as you can see , the device enters the body through the natural channels .
doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole .
no open surgery was necessary .
that 's very rewarding from the medical and human point of view .
we lost the fear of creating something new .
the path , it 's not easy .
many obstacles arise all the time .
but we receive strength from our patients .
their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
so we have to start a foundation with a one-to-one model .
so i grew up in limpopo , on the border of limpopo and mpumalanga , a little town called motetema .
water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , i was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
the limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
`` so as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , `` '' man , why does n't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you do n't have to bathe ? '' '' and i sat , and i was like , `` '' man , i would buy that , eh ? '' '' so i went home , and i did a little research , and i found some very shocking statistics . ''
over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
four hundred and fifty million of them are in africa , and five million of them are in south africa .
various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
the disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . the shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
`` so after seeing these shocking statistics , i thought to myself , `` '' okay , even if i 'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that i do n't want to bathe , i at least need to do it to try to save the world . '' '' ( laughter ) so with my trusty little steed , my nokia 6234 cell phone — i did n't have a laptop , i did n't have internet much , except for the 20-rand-an-hour internet cafe — i did research on wikipedia , on google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities — i did high school science — and i wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper , ''
and it looked like the kfc special spice , you know ?
so i was like , okay , so we 've got the formula ready .
now we need to get this thing into practice .
`` fast forward four years later , after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , i 'm the youngest patent-holder in the country , and — ( `` '' no more bathing ! '' '' ) — i ca n't say any more than that . ( laughter ) i had invented drybath , the world 's first bath-substituting lotion . ''
you literally put it on your skin , and you do n't have to bathe .
( laughter ) so after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources i had , i went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that 's ready to go to the market . it 's actually available on the market .
so we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making drybath available .
one of the things we learned was that poor communities do n't buy products in bulk .
they buy products on demand . a person in alex does n't buy a box of cigarettes . they buy one cigarette each day , even though it 's more expensive .
so we packaged drybath in these innovative little sachets .
you just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
and the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
after creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath . ( laughter ) at least once a week .
anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
after seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
drybath is a rich man 's convenience and a poor man 's lifesaver .
having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question i have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , i came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
what 's stopping you ? ( applause ) i 'm not done yet . i 'm not done yet .
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
i 'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first african to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , i did all of this just because i did n't want to bathe . thank you .
( applause . )
five years ago , i was on a sabbatical , and i returned to the medical university where i studied .
i saw real patients and i wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since i became a management consultant .
there were two things that surprised me during the month i spent .
the first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues i met , former friends from medical school , who i knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people i 'd ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
so with this focus on cost-cutting , i asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
many countries that you represent and where i come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
it 's a big part of the national budgets .
and many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
in some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
in other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore do n't reach patients .
in several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
after all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
so , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
and ultimately , some physicians will say today that they do n't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
so no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
we call this value-based healthcare .
on the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
this was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by michael porter and elizabeth teisberg .
on this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
when we started doing our research at bcg , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
you compare hospitals in a country , you 'll find some that are extremely good , but you 'll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
the differences were dramatic .
erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
now living in europe , he can choose to go to germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
if he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
you flip a coin . fifty percent risk . that 's quite a lot .
if he instead would go to hamburg , and to a clinic called the martini-klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
that 's a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
when we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
but you and i do n't know . we do n't have the data .
and often , the data actually does n't exist .
nobody knows .
so going the hospital is a lottery .
now , it does n't have to be that way . there is hope .
in the late '70s , there were a group of swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
to the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
they all realized they had their individual way of operating .
`` they all argued that , `` '' my technique is the best , '' '' but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that . ''
`` so they said , `` '' we probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what 's best . '' '' so they in fact spent two years debating , `` so what is quality in hip surgery ? '' ''
`` `` oh , we should measure this . '' `` no , we should measure that . '' ''
and they finally agreed .
and once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
they published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
since then , they publish every year .
once a year , they publish the league table : who 's best , who 's at the bottom ?
and they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
for many years , swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
now i found this principle really exciting .
so the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who 's best , and they learn from it .
continuous improvement .
now , that 's not the only exciting part .
that 's exciting in itself .
but if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that 's not been the purpose in the first place .
so if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the u.s. and sweden .
they looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
in the united states , the number was three times higher than in sweden .
so many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
we did a study where we looked at oecd data .
oecd does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
the united states has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in oecd .
that 's 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it 's all logical , but is it possible ?
this would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and i would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
the agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
in my practice as a consultant , i meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
the one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
they were always best in class .
we were always best in class .
and if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
but most of them do n't know .
but physicians have another characteristic .
they actually thrive from peer recognition .
if a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
they will share the information on how to improve .
so it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this is n't only an idea .
this is happening in reality .
we 're creating a global community , and a large global community , where we 'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
together with two academic institutions , michael porter at harvard business school , and the karolinska institute in sweden , bcg has formed something we call ichom .
you may think that 's a sneeze , but it 's not a sneeze , it 's an acronym .
it stands for the international consortium for health outcome measurement .
we 're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
they 've worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
the four groups will publish their data in november of this year .
that 's the first time we 'll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
next year , we 're planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
in three years ' time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
compare apples to apples . who 's better ?
why is that ?
five months ago , i led a workshop at the largest university hospital in northern europe .
they have a new ceo , and she has a vision : i want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
this particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
the group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
can we measure it better than we do ?
we discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
and we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
there was an enormous energy in the room .
there were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
at the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
`` he looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , i forgot that — he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , `` '' thank you . ''
`` thank you . today , we 're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . '' '' by measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution . ''
i believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and i 'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the greek hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
thank you .
( applause )
you get them to achieve unbelievable things .
we learned a lot from those failures .
so i tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure .
so much about a team 's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer .
the customer is the true reality .
then i started looking at the business model .
does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues ?
that started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success .
is the idea way too early and the world 's not ready for it ?
is it early , as in , you 're in advance and you have to educate the world ?
so i tried to rank across all of those attributes how i felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions .
timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
and then some of our failures .
but timing might matter even more .
i 'd done well at school . expectations for me were high , and i gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
underneath , i was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened — frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that i felt was within me .
`` i was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as i 'd done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice calmly observe , `` she is leaving the room . '' ''
i looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
`` `` she is opening the door . '' ''
this was the beginning . the voice had arrived .
and the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything i did in the third person .
`` `` she is going to a lecture . '' ''
it was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
so , for example , if i was angry and had to hide it , which i often did , being very adept at concealing how i really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
a subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people do n't hear voices and the fact that i did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
i spent some time telling the college g.p .
and to be fair , i was desperate for interest and help , and i began to tell him about my strange commentator .
`` for example , i was part of a student tv station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , i said , `` '' i 'm sorry , doctor , i 've got to go . ''
it was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
a hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
but having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
you see that glass of water ?
in effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which i felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
by now , i had the whole frenzied repertoire : terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
a broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person i was destined to be .
many people have harmed me in my life , and i remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who 've helped me .
i believe that eleanor can get through this .
`` sometimes , you know , it snows as late as may , but summer always comes eventually . '' '' fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place . ''
now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what i 'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
so for example , voices which threatened to attack my home i learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
now at first , i would have believed them .
i remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents ' room to protect them from what i thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
`` it was like , `` '' do n't mess with me . ''
`` i 've got a plastic fork , do n't you know ? '' '' strategic . ''
it was armed with this knowledge that ultimately i would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
i 'm now very proud to be a part of intervoice , the organizational body of the international hearing voices movement , an initiative inspired by the work of professor marius romme and dr. sandra escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
this type of society is not only possible , it 's already on its way .
to paraphrase chavez , once social change begins , it can not be reversed .
you can not humiliate the person who feels pride .
you can not oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
in the last 20 years , the hearing voices movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
as peter levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
in this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone 's suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
we are unique . we are irreplaceable .
what lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
the light never goes out .
`` as a very wonderful doctor once said to me , `` '' do n't tell me what other people have told you about yourself . ''
`` tell me about you . '' '' thank you . ''
( applause )
it 's just really about combining different realities .
the release of these papers from panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world .
the prime minister of iceland has resigned .
why should we care about this ?
but the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
we have the world 's media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets — something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade .
now , i think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
i like to think of it a bit like a russian doll .
so you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
i also think it 's interesting that there 's been less coverage of this issue in the united states .
and that 's perhaps because some prominent us people just have n't figured in this exposé , in this scandal .
now , that 's not because there are no rich americans who are stashing their assets offshore .
it 's just because of the way in which offshore works , mossack fonseca has fewer american clients .
i think if we saw leaks from the cayman islands or even from delaware or wyoming or nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to americans .
in fact , in a number of us states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
this is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
now , at global witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
how does this actually work ?
it 's also important to not just think about this as individual cases .
this is not just about an individual lawyer who 's spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions .
it 's not just about a particular senior politician who 's been caught up in a scandal .
and in order to tackle this , we need to change the game .
but as a natural optimist , i do see that we are starting to get some change .
over the last couple of years , we 've seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership .
this issue was put on the political agenda by the uk prime minister david cameron at a big g8 summit that was held in northern ireland in 2013 .
and since then , the european union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across europe .
one of the things that is sad is that , actually , the us is lagging behind .
there 's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the house and the senate , but it is n't making as much progress as we 'd like to see .
for us at global witness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
`` we need business leaders to stand up and say , `` secrecy like this is not good for business . '' ''
we need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
together , we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion , corruption , money laundering to flourish .
chris anderson : julian , welcome .
how do people release the documents ?
so let 's take [ an ] example , actually .
he was a soft dictator of kenya .
this is — this is intense material , i should warn you .
radio : ... just fuckin ' , once you get on 'em just open 'em up .
i see your element , uh , got about four humvees , uh , out along ...
light 'em all up .
hotel ... bushmaster two-six , bushmaster two-six ,
two-six , this is two-six , we 're mobile .
oops , i 'm sorry . what was going on ?
god damn it , kyle . all right , hahaha . i hit 'em .
ca : so , what was the impact of that ?
there were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
ca : so they are well-motivated .
dangerous troublemaker .
ja : oh , come on . there must be some .
and part of the albanian government was in this , etc. , etc .
can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
ja : yeah , we have a lot , but i mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
you know , i was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
i wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when i was a teenager .
so you have to be careful with hacker .
ja : i 'm not sure which way it 's going to go .
this is a very serious problem . it 's ordinarily not addressed .
but the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position .
when i was in office as governor of georgia , one out of every 1,000 americans were in prison .
nowadays , 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison .
that 's a sevenfold increase .
if you add that up , that 's 307 million dollars it costs california to send a person to be executed .
genital mutilation is horrible and not known by american women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that 's a girl , very soon in her life , her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and , in a non-sterilized way , they remove the exterior parts of a woman 's genitalia .
and sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate .
in egypt , for instance , 91 percent of all the females that live in egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way .
there are 30 million people now living in slavery .
it 's the number one place in the nation because of that .
in the military , they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place .
those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
when i became president , the difference was 39 percent .
these are the kind of things that go on .
well , that 's what goes on in our country .
other times , of course , now , we have drones that attack people and so forth .
so what is the basic thing that we need to do today ?
i think now i never was pure .
human contracted itself blind , malignant .
redemption , smoke .
when i was a student here in oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
the population explosion was unstoppable .
global famine was inevitable .
a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
the acid rain was falling on the forests .
the desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
the oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
none of those things happened , ( laughter ) and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per-capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
child mortality is down by two-thirds .
per-capita food production is up by a third .
and all this at a time when the population has doubled .
how did we achieve that , whether you think it 's a good thing or not ?
how did we achieve that ?
how did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous ?
the size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents gdp per capita .
i think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
in other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
i want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
these are both real objects .
one is an acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by homo erectus .
the other is obviously a computer mouse .
they 're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
i 've tried to work out which is bigger , and it 's almost impossible .
and that 's because they 're both designed to fit the human hand .
they 're both technologies . in the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
the differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years — from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago .
homo erectus made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
there was no progress , no innovation .
it 's an extraordinary phenomenon , but it 's true .
whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
and there 's another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
the object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
and more than that , it 's a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
they 've all been combined together in this technology .
and it 's this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because i think it 's the secret to understanding what 's happening in the world .
my body 's an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
they 've come together .
how does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things ?
well , it uses sexual reproduction .
in an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
one goes extinct for the other to survive .
but if you have a sexual species , then it 's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
so what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
it 's not confined to its own lineage .
what 's the process that 's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
and i think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
it 's a unique human feature .
no other animal does it .
you can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there 's reciprocity in other animals — but the exchange of one object for another never happens .
`` as adam smith said , `` '' no man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . '' '' ( laughter ) you can have culture without exchange . ''
you can have , as it were , asexual culture .
chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
they teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
in this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
but the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
there 's no exchange of ideas between them .
and why does exchange raise living standards ?
well , the answer came from david ricardo in 1817 .
and here is a stone age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam .
he does n't need adam .
he can make his own spears and axes .
well no , because if you think about it , if oz makes two spears and adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
and the more they do this , the more true it 's going to be , because the more they do this , the better adam is going to get at making axes and the better oz is going to get at making spears .
so the gains from trade are only going to grow .
and this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
adam and oz both saved an hour of time .
that is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
if you had to start from scratch , let 's say you go out into the countryside .
you find a sheep . you kill it . you get the fat out of it .
you render it down . you make a candle , etc . etc .
how long is it going to take you ? quite a long time .
how long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you 're on the average wage in britain today ?
and the answer is about half a second .
back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
and that 's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you 've gained since 1950 , as it were , because that 's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
and back in 1880 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
back in 1800 , you 'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
in other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
`` go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : `` '' who made them and for who ? '' '' the stone axe was made by someone for himself . ''
it was self-sufficiency .
we call that poverty these days .
but the object on the right was made for me by other people .
how many other people ?
tens ? hundreds ? thousands ?
you know , i think it 's probably millions .
because you 've got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
they were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
and that 's the way society works .
that 's what we 've achieved as a species .
in the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
that 's how you got to be rich ; you employed them .
louis xiv had a lot of people working for him .
they made his silly outfits , like this , ( laughter ) and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
he had 498 people to prepare his dinner every night .
but a modern tourist going around the palace of versailles and looking at louis xiv 's pictures , he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too .
they 're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over paris , and they 're all ready to serve you at an hour 's notice with an excellent meal that 's probably got higher quality than louis xiv even had .
and that 's what we 've done , because we 're all working for each other .
we 're able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other 's living standards .
now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
but there 's a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
there 's no working for each other across the colonies .
and the reason for that is because there 's a reproductive division of labor .
that is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
the queen does it all .
in our species , we do n't like doing that .
it 's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
( laughter ) even in england , we do n't leave reproduction to the queen .
( applause ) so when did this habit start ?
and how long has it been going on ? and what does it mean ?
well , i think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
but i 've got no evidence for that .
it just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
in all hunter-gatherer societies today , there 's a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
it is n't always quite that simple , but there 's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
and the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
the woman knows that , in the hadzas ' case here — digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
and she does n't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
and the man knows that he does n't have to do any digging to get roots .
all he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it 's big enough to share some .
and so both sides raise each other 's standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
when did this happen ? we do n't know , but it 's possible that neanderthals did n't do this .
they were a highly cooperative species .
they were a highly intelligent species .
their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
they were imaginative . they buried their dead .
they had language , probably , because we know they had the foxp2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in oxford .
and so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
they were brilliant people . i 'm not dissing the neanderthals .
but there 's no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
there 's no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
it looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
and the other thing there 's no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
for example , in the caucasus there 's a site where you find local neanderthal tools .
they 're always made from local chert .
in the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more — but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
and when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
trade is 10 times as old as farming .
people forget that . people think of trade as a modern thing .
exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
and the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in ethiopia .
you also see seashells — as discovered by a team here in oxford — moving 125 miles inland from the mediterranean in algeria .
and that 's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
and that will have led to specialization .
how do you know that long-distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called mount isa , which was a quarry owned by the kalkadoon tribe .
they traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of australia .
so long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
what happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
and the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
an example is tasmania .
when the sea level rose and tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
it 's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
how many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
it did n't happen in tierra del fuego — similar island , similar people .
the reason : because tierra del fuego is separated from south america by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
the tasmanians were isolated .
go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
in the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
nobody , literally nobody .
there is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
i mean this quite seriously .
the president of the computer mouse company does n't know .
he just knows how to run a company .
the person on the assembly line does n't know because he does n't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
we all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
`` i am of course quoting from a famous essay by leonard read , the economist in the 1950s , called `` '' i , pencil '' '' in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it do n't know how to mine graphite , and they do n't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing . ''
and what we 've done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we 've created the ability to do things that we do n't even understand .
it 's not the same with language .
with language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
but with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
we 've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
and by the way , that 's one of the reasons that i 'm not interested in the debate about i.q. , about whether some groups have higher i.q.s than other groups .
it 's completely irrelevant .
what 's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they 're cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
so we 've created something called the collective brain .
we 're just the nodes in the network .
we 're the neurons in this brain .
it 's the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
however , bad things happen .
and in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
there will be wars ; there will be depressions ; there will be natural disasters .
awful things will happen in this century , i 'm absolutely sure .
but i 'm also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , i 'm also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we 've created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
thank you .
( applause )
you look around at all these museums here .
so this is all of the meta-data information .
but what if you want to see brush strokes ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
you zoom in . you really go in .
i 'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i 'm really going to get to the cracks .
`` this is `` '' the starry night , '' '' i think , never seen like this before . ''
i 'm going to show you my other favorite feature .
there 's a lot of other stuff here , but i do n't have time .
this is the real cool part . it 's called collections .
any one of you , anybody — does n't matter if you 're rich , if you 're poor , if you have a fancy house — does n't matter .
you can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
very simply , you go in — and i 've created this , called the power of zoom — you can just zoom around .
`` this is `` '' the ambassadors , '' '' based in the national gallery . ''
so i think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
it does n't , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
i probably should n't say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that 's been my humbling experience in this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
it 's to supplement the experience .
and that 's it . thank you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
on the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , turkish woman .
i asked her how she did this . was it the power of praying ?
we 're born into a certain family , nation , class .
instead , i began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
the child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
i experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
i started writing fiction in english .
and because god loves her , i did get married .
when my first novel written in english came out in america , i heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
`` `` i liked your book , '' he said , `` but i wish you had written it differently . '' ''
it was only because of our passports .
`` and only the latter is an artist 's responsibility . '' '' identity politics divides us . fiction connects . ''
everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sultan , muslims and non-muslims .
literature has to take us beyond .
as you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
as long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
they connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
we are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
( applause )
and i 'll get to that in a minute .
in fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
it 's fixed in a clenched spasm and it 's excruciatingly painful .
some of them are driven to suicide , ok ?
maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
`` `` oh my god , oh my god , it 's moving again ! '' ''
`` so , i said , `` '' look , derek '' '' — well , first of all , the guy ca n't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain — i said , `` '' look , derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two . ''
it goes into a sort of denial — it gates the signals .
this was discovered by francis galton in the nineteenth century .
he was a cousin of charles darwin .
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
why would that be ?
here , you 've got martian alphabet .
one of them is kiki , one of them is bouba .
this story is about taking imagination seriously .
fourteen years ago , i first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
today , i 'm using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .
i was an unlikely person to be doing this .
i never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
in fact , after college i applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
i went off on my own to become an artist , and i painted for 10 years , when i was offered a fulbright to india .
promising to give exhibitions of paintings , i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram .
the deadline for the show arrived — my paints did n't .
i had to do something .
this fishing village was famous for sculpture .
so i tried bronze casting .
but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
i went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
i 'd seen it every day , but this time i saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
my first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
`` it 's a self-portrait titled `` '' wide hips . '' '' ( laughter ) we hoisted them on poles to photograph . ''
i discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
i was mesmerized .
i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in lithuania with lace makers .
i liked the fine detail it gave my work , but i wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
returning to india to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots — installed briefly in madrid .
thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist manual sola-morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto , portugal .
he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
i did n't know if i could do that and preserve my art .
durable , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
for two years , i searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
so we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring .
we had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
but there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
i found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for america 's cup racing yachts named peter heppel .
he helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
i could n't build this the way i knew because hand-tied knots were n't going to withstand a hurricane .
so i developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
there was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
so we had to create one .
three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net .
it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
( applause ) this intersection had been bland and anonymous .
now it had a sense of place .
i walked underneath it for the first time .
as i watched the wind 's choreography unfold , i felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
my life was not going to be the same .
i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
i 'm going to share two directions that are new in my work .
historic philadelphia city hall : its plaza , i felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
i 'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an x-ray of the city 's circulatory system unfolding .
next challenge , the biennial of the americas in denver asked , could i represent the 35 nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ?
( laughter ) i did n't know where to begin , but i said yes .
i read about the recent earthquake in chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean .
it shifted the earth 's tectonic plates , sped up the planet 's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
so i contacted noaa , and i asked if they 'd share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
`` its title : `` '' 1.26 '' '' refers to the number of microseconds that the earth 's day was shortened . ''
i could n't build this with a steel ring , the way i knew .
its shape was too complex now .
so i replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
the sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
there was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
so we had to create it .
then i got a call from new york city asking if i could adapt these concepts to times square or the high line .
this new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
they do n't have funding yet , but i dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they 're most needed .
fourteen years ago , i searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
now i combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
my artistic horizons continue to grow .
i 'll leave you with this story .
i got a call from a friend in phoenix .
an attorney in the office who 'd never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
there they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they did n't know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
thank you .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . ( applause )
the way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
after puberty , we fall off the map .
she 's a six-monther .
( applause )
and in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
