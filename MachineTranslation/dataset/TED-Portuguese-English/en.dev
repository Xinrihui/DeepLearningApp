that 's twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
now , where do you find such goldilocks conditions ?
but of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
each rung contains information .
i was not an activist .
the fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
in fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
this was n't a brothel , per se .
this is a family portrait .
`` `` '' we have no freedom , '' '' they said . ''
when we first arrived , i went to have a quick look .
this young child is eight years old .
many of them drown .
all of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
( applause )
and the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
thank you very much .
in an age of global strife and climate change , i 'm here to answer the all important question : why is sex so damn good ?
if you 're laughing , you know what i mean .
here 's why . back in university , we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks .
here 's my clock .
it uses something called the dwarf sunflower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
now , as you know , sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day .
so in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
at noon , you mark the changed position of the sunflower , and in the evening again , and that 's your clock .
now , i know my clock does n't tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
so , in my completely unbiased , subjective opinion , it 's brilliant .
however , here 's chris 's clock .
it 's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
in each shot glass is a different scented oil .
in the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass , focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath .
this will warm up the scented oil inside , and a particular smell will be emitted .
so during the course of the day , five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment .
anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
you can see why i hate chris .
one thing you have to know about me is i hate to lose .
this problem 's been bugging me for well over a decade .
all right , let 's get back to the question of why sex is so good .
many years after the solar powered clocks project , a young lady i knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
and when she said this , i had an epiphany .
so i decided to evaluate different experiences i had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
to do this , i devised something called the five senses graph .
along the y-axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
anytime i had a memorable experience in my life , i would record it on this graph like a five senses diary .
here 's a quick video to show you how it works .
bike designer : this is [ unclear ] , custom bike designer .
( motorcyle revving ) [ sound ] [ touch ] [ sight ] [ smell ] [ taste ] jl : and that 's how the five senses graph works .
so here are some other results .
the first is for instant noodles .
now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
you know . ( slurps ) needless to say , i no longer dine with these people .
ok , next , clubbing .
these people i still do hang out with .
all right , and smoking .
here i found touch is at [ six ] , and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it 's kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers .
ok. now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
it would , of course , be a horizontal line along the top .
now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
in fact , in the years that i gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
that is , of course , sex . great sex .
respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
so the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
now in the middle of all this five senses work , i suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth .
and i realized this theory also explains why chris 's clock is so much better than mine .
you see , my clock only focuses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
here 's chris 's clock .
it 's the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
in fact , in terms of the five senses , chris 's clock is a revolution .
and that 's what this theory taught me about my field .
you see , up till now , us designers , we 've mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we 've ignored the other three senses .
chris 's clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
so what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
here 's three quick ideas i came up with .
`` we could call this `` '' the perfumator . '' '' all right , next . ''
so i brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy , and when the taste of candy ran out , you 'd know it 's time to change your toothbrush ?
finally , i have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet .
it 's not just the way they look , but i love the way they feel when you press down on them .
now , i do n't play the flute or the clarinet , so i decided to combine these keys with an instrument i do play : the television remote control .
now , when we look at these three ideas together , you 'll notice that the five senses theory does n't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
now , i realize the five senses is n't the only thing that makes life interesting .
there 's also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
oh , one last thing before i leave .
and the best way to do that is with free candy .
you guys ready ?
all right .
( applause )
what could go wrong ?
but i do n't know who felt worse that day .
and without the humor .
that 's one version .
and i did n't make this up , i did write that letter .
you get the idea .
i jumped on it , because that was where bill gates lived , right ?
i did n't even start .
it 's not because he did n't try .
and that rejection hurt me .
so this is where i went online and looked for help .
google was my friend .
day one ...
( arabic ) i seek refuge in allah from cursed satan . in the name of allah , the most gracious , the most merciful .
my mother had 16 pregnancies .
from 16 pregnancies , five of us are alive .
you can imagine as a child what i went through .
i wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
unfortunately , in my country , there was n't a dormitory for girls , so i was accepted in medical school , but i could not go there .
so as a result , my father sent me to america .
i came to america .
my family was in a refugee camp .
so as soon as i completed my education , i brought my family to america .
i wanted them to be safe .
but where was my heart ?
my heart was in afghanistan .
i had a good job .
about 90 percent of them were women and children . most of the men have been killed or they were in war . and you know , in the refugee camp ,
when i went day-to-day to do a survey , i found things you never could imagine .
i saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
so it was a very devastating situation .
at that moment , we talk about momentum .
at that moment , i felt , what can i do for these people ?
how could i help these people ?
no , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
`` it was very hard to come and say , `` '' i want to do this . '' '' who am i ? ''
so i really needed to build the trust in this community .
i went and surveyed and looked and looked .
i asked .
he was 80 years old .
he was a mullah .
one day i was in the office in peshawar , pakistan .
they were the ugliest looking men you can ever see .
`` they asked me , `` '' what are you doing ? ''
by that time , my staff poured into my office .
i am very shaken up , and i told myself , this is it .
there is no doubt in my mind .
that tells you that education transforms people .
but you know what happened to my country .
but we want the same afghanistan we had before .
they are earning degrees . they are training to be lawyers .
we have one poet , mawlānā rūmī .
this is where i live . i live in kenya , at the south parts of the nairobi national park .
those are my dad 's cows at the back , and behind the cows , that 's the nairobi national park .
nairobi national park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
they kill our livestock .
this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and i just woke up in the morning and i found it dead , and i felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
my community , the maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that 's why we value them so much .
so i grew up hating lions so much .
the morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they 're also upset about this problem .
so they kill the lions .
it 's one of the six lions which were killed in nairobi .
and i think this is why the nairobi national park lions are few .
so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad 's cows , and that 's the same thing which happened to me .
so i had to find a way of solving this problem .
and the first idea i got was to use fire , because i thought lions were scared of fire .
but i came to realize that that did n't really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
so i did n't give up . i continued .
and a second idea i got was to use a scarecrow .
i was trying to trick the lions [ into thinking ] that i was standing near the cowshed .
but lions are very clever . ( laughter ) they will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they 'll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it 's always here . ( laughter ) so he jumps in and kills the animals .
so one night , i was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions did n't come .
and i discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
so i had an idea .
since i was a small boy , i used to work in my room for the whole day , and i even took apart my mom 's new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but i learned a lot about electronics . ( laughter ) so i got an old car battery , an indicator box . it 's a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . it blinks .
and i got a switch where i can switch on the lights , on and off .
and that 's a small torch from a broken flashlight .
so i set up everything .
as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . i call it a transformer .
and the indicator box makes the lights flash .
as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that 's where the lions come from .
and that 's how it looks to lions when they come at night .
the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking i was walking around the cowshed , but i was sleeping in my bed .
( laughter ) ( applause ) thanks .
so i set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if i could put the lights for her .
`` and i said , `` '' yes . '' '' so i put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights . ''
since now , i 've set up seven homes around my community , and they 're really working .
and my idea is also being used now all over kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it 's also being used to scare elephants away from people 's farms .
because of this invention , i was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in kenya , brookhouse international school , and i 'm really excited about this .
my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
i even took my friends back to my community , and we 're installing the lights to the homes which do n't have [ any ] , and i 'm teaching them how to put them .
so one year ago , i was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father 's cows , and i used to see planes flying over , and i told myself that one day , i 'll be there inside .
and here i am today .
i got a chance to come by plane for my first time for ted .
so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when i grow up .
i used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father 's cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
ashê olên . it means in my language , thank you very much .
( applause ) chris anderson : you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
so you got this scholarship.richard turere : yep .
ca : you 're working on other electrical inventions .
what 's the next one on your list ?
rt : my next invention is , i want to make an electric fence.ca : electric fence ?
rt : but i know electric fences are already invented , but i want to make mine .
( laughter ) ca : you already tried it once , right , and you —rt : i tried it before , but i stopped because it gave me a shock . ( laughter ) ca : in the trenches . richard turere , you are something else .
we 're going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
thank you so much.rt : thank you . ( applause )
server : would you like any desserts , sir ?
ideas can spark a movement .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
our magazines are read by millions .
when i was seven years old , i saw my first public execution .
i had no idea what life was going to be like as a north korean refugee .
if anything seemed unnatural , i could be imprisoned and repatriated .
even though i was really fortunate to get out , many other north koreans have not been so lucky .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
we are all korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 years of division .
am i south korean or north korean ?
so i started planning how to help them escape .
i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
( music ) ( applause )
this is how the rooftop looks .
and why did we design this ?
`` i said , `` '' it 's impossible . '' '' but he insisted : `` '' how about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof ? ''
but we could keep that idea around the trees .
and we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail .
but of course , rope has nothing to do with them .
and you get more , and more , more .
( laughter ) sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
and also there is no boundary between classrooms .
when you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
but in this kindergarten , there is no reason they get nervous .
because there is no boundary .
and the principal says if the boy in the corner does n't want to stay in the room , we let him go .
he will come back eventually , because it 's a circle , it comes back .
( laughter ) but the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
but here , just they leave and come back .
it 's a natural process .
you know that children sleep better in noise .
and in this kindergarten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
and you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
and you know , you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar .
you know , it 's completely open .
in summer you go swimming .
the sand is 50 degrees .
so that is how we should treat them .
this is how they divide classrooms .
they are supposed to help teachers .
they do n't .
( laughter ) i did n't put him in .
a classroom .
and a washbasin .
and there are always some trees in the classroom .
a monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
( laughter ) monkeys . ( laughter )
and each classroom has at least one skylight .
and this is where santa claus comes down at the time of christmas .
this is the annex building , right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten .
the building is only five meters tall with seven floors .
and of course , the ceiling height is very low .
so , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
they tried to go in .
he hit his head .
he 's okay . his skull is quite strong .
he is resilient . it 's my son .
( laughter ) and he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
and then we put other children .
( laughter ) the driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
now these days , kids need a small dosage of danger .
and in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
this is society . this is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
so it 's not exactly small at all .
and this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
but the surprise is yet to come .
`` just like sheep . '' '' ( laughter ) they keep running . ( laughter ) ''
my point is do n't control them , do n't protect them too much , and they need to tumble sometimes .
they need to get some injury .
i think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people 's lives .
and this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
thank you very much .
here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
they 're exactly what they sound like .
they are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
so most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collections of stars , or galaxies .
now , by showing you some of these images , i hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , i think galaxy clusters are mysterious , they are surprising , and they 're useful .
useful as the universe 's most massive laboratories .
and as laboratories , to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
and i think there are four major types , and the first type that i want to describe is probing the very big .
so , how big ?
well , here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster .
it is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent , it 's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster .
and , in fact , if you look very carefully you 'll be able to see rings around this cluster .
now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns .
it 's just mind-boggling how massive these systems can get .
but more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
they are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe .
and many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
might be answered by studying these systems .
so that was very big .
the second things is very hot .
okay , if i take an image of a galaxy cluster , and i subtract away all of the starlight , what i 'm left with is this big , blue blob .
this is in false color .
it 's actually x-ray light that we 're seeing .
and the question is , if it 's not galaxies , what is emitting this light ?
the answer is hot gas , million-degree gas — in fact , it 's plasma .
and the reason why it 's so hot goes back to the previous slide .
the extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds , and great speeds means great temperatures .
so this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
there are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
third thing : probing the very small .
now , to explain this , i need to tell you a very disturbing fact .
most of the universe 's matter is not made up of atoms .
you were lied to .
most of it is made up of something very , very mysterious , which we call dark matter .
dark matter is something that does n't like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
if you 're a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we smash things together .
and dark matter is no exception .
well , how do we do this ?
to answer that question , i 'm going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clusters collide ?
here is an image .
since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe , scaled-down versions .
they are mostly made up of dark matter , and that 's what you see in this bluish purple .
the red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
what 's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge , huge scale .
and this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
so , it 's very funny .
the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter , the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small , is precisely because they are so very big .
fourth thing : the physics of the very strange .
certainly what i 've said so far is crazy .
okay , if there 's anything stranger i think it has to be dark energy .
if i throw a ball into the air , i expect it to go up .
what i do n't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .
similarly , cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding .
they do n't understand why it 's expanding at an ever-increasing rate .
they give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
and , again , we want to learn more about it .
so , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
depending on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or slower .
well , the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it 's horribly complicated .
here is a computer simulation .
and we need a way to simplify it .
well , i like to think about this using an analogy .
if i want to understand the sinking of the titanic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
the most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
similarly , i can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies .
so , as i come to a close , you might feel slightly cheated .
i mean , i began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful , and i 've given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
well , to answer this , i want to give you a quote by henry ford when he was asked about cars .
`` he had this to say : `` '' if i had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster horses . '' '' today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems . ''
and the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
they are not faster horses .
they will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity .
so , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentrate , but we also need to remember that innovation , ingenuity , inspiration — these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
and i ca n't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . thanks .
( applause )
who am i ?
i love animals .
ten years ago , i got a phone call that changed my life .
the call came from a veterinarian at the los angeles zoo .
an elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she 'd had a stroke .
and this procedure , which i have done on many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that paw and that tail .
and here 's what started coming into very clear focus for me .
now , i 've got a confession to make .
well , i 'm trying these days .
when i see a human patient now , i always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that i do n't know ?
`` but it turns out , this `` '' new '' '' human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human . ''
some animal patients also harm themselves .
but veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare .
to explain it , i 'm afraid i 'm going to have to air some dirty laundry .
but here 's one from the vets : what do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species ?
thank you .
now , i 'm going to take you on a little journey here .
okay , i spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
it was insidious and it was really happening .
anybody ? boy you 're lucky .
but none of that 's in my medical record .
so , our cell phones can now build a place history .
just look at that for a minute .
no adults believed i was serious .
encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
it offers many insights .
a map actually carries somebody 's view .
comparative reading actually is nothing new .
and a couple of other countries which we 've invaded .
you probably wo n't .
this is a problem we have to solve .
they put it online for free .
my guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
but with the internet , she 's in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
and the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
he finds a local sporting team .
he trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
for some of us it might be music . for some of us it might be food .
my challenge instead is this .
and we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
it used to be that paris and london and new york were the largest cities .
they have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life .
they are constantly upgrading , and in a few cases , the government helps .
so i was on a national television prime-time show .
a father posted his son 's picture onto the internet .
( applause )
this back here was my brain cancer .
`` ( laughter ) the key phrase is `` '' was , '' '' phew . ''
i knew nothing about cancer .
and everyone changes as well .
you suddenly become a disease on legs .
doctors start speaking a language which you do n't understand .
`` these are the `` '' can i ? '' '' questions : can i work while i have cancer ? ''
can i study ? can i make love ? can i be creative ?
`` and you wonder , `` '' what have i done to deserve this ? '' '' you wonder , `` '' can i change something about my lifestyle ? '' '' you wonder , `` '' can i do something ? ''
but instead , you 're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers .
it was really hard to obtain , because it 's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
i 'm an artist , i use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
i actually had to hack it and that 's a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
i was interested in the social cure , i was interested in the psychological cure , i was interested in the spiritual cure , i was interested in the emotional cure , i was interested in any form of cure .
and , it worked .
the la cura website went viral .
for example , here we see francesca fini in her performance .
now you can have my cancer , too !
( laughter ) which is a nice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer .
and together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures .
and the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me .
so i was able to take my time and choose .
everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well , and this was the most important part of la cura .
what are the outcomes ?
i 'm fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
i have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
everything i did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged .
obviously , there were .
thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
this global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
and from what i feel , it 's a cure for me , but for us all .
thank you .
( applause ) .
a big challenge is , how should the ipads be used , and what apps should we put on the ipads ?
hi everybody . so my name is mac .
it was going to be the highlight of our store .
mammoth chunks . these things weigh , like , seven pounds each .
and so i try to do this in my books .
and here 's just one example .
this is the first book that i ever made .
this market 's crazy , everybody .
mac barnett : so nico called back , like , an hour later .
but we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression , but a lasting one that remains .
i was born in a family full of colors .
my father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone .
he was adopted by those who i know as my grandparents .
the matriarch , my grandma , has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair .
my grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone , like my uncle and my cousin .
my mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native brazilian , with a pinch of hazel and honey , and a man [ who is ] a mix of coffee with milk , but with a lot of coffee .
she has two sisters .
one in a toasted-peanut skin and the other , also adopted , more on the beige side , like a pancake .
outside home , however , things were different soon .
color had many other meanings .
i remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings .
it was exciting and creative but i never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil .
i was made of flesh but i was n't pink .
my skin was brown , and people said i was black .
i was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head .
later , when i took my cousin to school , i was usually taken for the nanny .
by helping in the kitchen at a friend 's party , people thought i was the maid .
and many times , visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings , i was invited not to use the main elevator .
in some way , i get to used to it and accept part of it .
however , something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling .
years later i married a spaniard .
but not any spaniard .
i chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt .
( laughter ) since then , a new question started to chase me .
what will be the color of your children ?
as you can understand , this is my last concern .
but thinking about it , with my previous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer .
and that is how humanae was born .
humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors , rather than the untrue white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
it 's a kind of game to question our codes .
it 's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
i portray the subjects in a white background .
then i choose an 11-pixel square from the nose , paint the background , and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette , pantone .
i started with my family and friends , then more and more people joined the adventure , thanks to public calls coming through the social media .
i thought that the main space to show my work was the internet because i want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain .
the snowball started to roll .
the project had a great welcome — invitations , exhibitions , physical formats , galleries and museums ...
just happened .
and among them , my favorite : when humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street , it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
i have portrayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
just to mention some of them — from someone included in the forbes list , to refugees who crossed the mediterranean by boat .
in paris , from the unesco headquarters to a shelter .
and students both in switzerland and favelas in rio de janeiro .
all kinds of beliefs , gender identities or physical impairments , a newborn or terminally ill .
we all together build humanae .
those portraits make us rethink how we see each other .
when modern science is questioning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
this personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
suddenly i realized that humanae was useful for many people .
it represents a sort of mirror for those who can not find themselves reflected in any label .
it was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
`` so your work has a very special place in my heart and it 's very important for me . '' '' a woman shared her portrait on facebook and wrote , `` '' all my life , people from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group , a stereotype , a box . ''
perhaps we should stop .
instead of framing , ask the individual , 'how would you label yourself ? ' then i would say , 'hi . i 'm massiel .
`` i 'm a dominican-dutch , i grew up in a mixed family and i 'm a bisexual woman . ' `` `` besides these unexpected and touching reactions , humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields . ''
it 's a collection of faces .
researchers in the fields of anthropology , physics and neuroscience use humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity , optophysiology , face recognition or alzheimer 's .
one of the most important impacts of the project is that humanae was chosen to be the cover of foreign affairs , one of the most relevant political publications .
and talking about foreign affairs , i found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...
teachers .
they are the ones that use humanae as a tool for educational purposes .
their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes , but this time as a teacher myself .
my students , both adults and kids , paint their self-portraits , trying to discover their own unique color .
as a photographer , i realize that i can be a channel for others to communicate .
as an individual , as angélica , every time i take a picture , i feel that i am sitting in front of a therapist .
becomes love .
the last country — the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where i was born , brazil .
we still have to work hard to abolish discrimination .
that remains a common practice worldwide , and that will not disappear by itself .
thank you .
( applause ) thank you .
but let me get to the talk — i see the clock is running .
i 'm a public school teacher , and i just want to share a story of my superintendent .
her name is pam moran in albemarle county , virginia , the foothills of the blue ridge mountains .
i was a young man , and i had been dropping in and out of college .
it was an experimental education program .
i am one of her teaching gestures .
it 's an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
and so i 'm here standing on the shoulders of many people .
and it has four plexiglass layers .
there 's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
( video ) boy : the world peace game is serious .
so i 'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
and the defense minister — she had the tank corps and air force and so forth .
that 's a breach there .
had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
i could not have designed that in teaching it .
by the third sentence , she was in tears .
and it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
every game we play is different .
some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
some games are more about warfare .
if only .
( applause )
i 'm not really sure about the answer .
aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
it 's about creating a social impact .
mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
people have very different aptitudes .
vannevar bush was the u.s. government 's chief scientific adviser during the war .
you were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
and the third is commitment .
we need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
so , you know , there 's bars . and by the time that vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? your head gets bigger .
can i ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
so , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which i spent every working day of the last six years . ( laughter ) i teach high school math .
i sell a product to a market that does n't want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
i mean , it 's just a losing proposition .
so there 's a useful stereotype about students that i see , a useful stereotype about you all .
i could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and i would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
and both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the u.s. today .
to start with , i 'd like to break math down into two categories .
one is computation ; this is the stuff you 've forgotten .
for example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
this stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . math reasoning — we 'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
this is what we would love students to retain , even if they do n't go into mathematical fields .
this is also something that , the way we teach it in the u.s .
all but ensures they wo n't retain it .
so , i 'd like to talk about why that is , why that 's such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
so first , five symptoms that you 're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
one is a lack of initiative ; your students do n't self-start .
you finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
students lack perseverance .
they lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
there 's an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
and then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
this is really destructive .
`` david milch , creator of `` '' deadwood '' '' and other amazing tv shows , has a really good description for this . ''
`` he swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , `` '' two and a half men , '' '' no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems . ''
`` he called it , `` '' an impatience with irresolution . '' '' you 're impatient with things that do n't resolve quickly . ''
you expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
and i 'll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
i am very concerned about this because i 'm going to retire in a world that my students will run .
i 'm doing bad things to my own future and well-being when i teach this way .
`` i 'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks — particularly mass-adopted textbooks — teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it 's functionally equivalent to turning on `` '' two and a half men '' '' and calling it a day . ''
( laughter ) in all seriousness . here 's an example from a physics textbook .
it applies equally to math .
notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
i believe in real life .
and ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you did n't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you did n't have sufficient information and had to go find some .
i 'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
and the textbook , i think , knows how it 's hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
when it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we 're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
and if the student still does n't recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
you could literally , i mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . that 's a shame .
so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
here 's a really cool problem . i like this .
it 's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
but what you have here is actually four separate layers , and i 'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they 're compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
i 'll define them here : you have the visual .
you also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
you have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
so i hope you can see .
i really hope you can see how what we 're doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we 're paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
that 's all we 're doing here .
so i want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we 're looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
so right here i start with the visual , and i immediately ask the question : which section is the steepest ?
and this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
so you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
and then eventually we realize it 's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a , b , c and d labels to talk about them more easily .
and then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
and then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
the math serves the conversation , the conversation does n't serve the math .
and at that point , i 'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
but if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
it 's been obvious in my practice , to me .
and i 'll yield the floor here for a second to einstein , who , i believe , has paid his dues .
he talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the u.s. here , we just give problems to students ; we do n't involve them in the formulation of the problem .
so 90 percent of what i do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
and here 's how it works .
i like this question . it 's about a water tank .
the question is : how long will it take you to fill it up ?
first things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
and then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you 'll need .
none of it 's a distractor , so we lose that .
`` students need to decide , `` '' all right , well , does the height matter ? does the side of it matter ? ''
`` does the color of the valve matter ? what matters here ? '' '' such an underrepresented question in math curriculum . ''
so now we have a water tank .
how long will it take you to fill it up ? and that 's it .
and because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
so now we have the real deal .
how long will it take it to fill it up ?
and then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
and it 's filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
it 's tedious .
`` students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they 're all wondering at some point or another , `` man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? '' ''
( laughter ) that 's how you know you 've baited the hook , right ?
and that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , i teach kids — because of my inexperience — i teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
and i 've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so i wo n't talk about it .
but here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
`` everyone 's filled something up with water before , so i get kids answering the question , `` '' how long will it take ? '' '' i 've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation . ''
we put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
and then we follow the process i 've described .
and the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we do n't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher 's edition .
we , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
( laughter ) and that 's terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher 's edition , that 's great , but it 's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
but those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
so i 'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
these are the kids who now , one semester in , i can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they 'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
we 're no longer averse to word problems , because we 've redefined what a word problem is .
we 're no longer intimidated by math , because we 're slowly redefining what math is .
this has been a lot of fun .
i encourage math teachers i talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : it 's buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
it 's ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
i put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
`` i get emails still from teachers in countries i 've never visited saying , `` '' wow , yeah . we had a good conversation about that . ''
`` oh , and by the way , here 's how i made your stuff better , '' '' which , wow . ''
i put this problem on my blog recently : in a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
`` and the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on `` '' good morning america '' '' a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ? ''
and from all of this , i can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
math makes sense of the world .
math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
so i just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education — whether you 're a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — insist on better math curriculum .
we need more patient problem solvers . thank you . ( applause )
it means to play softly .
`` if you 're playing a musical instrument and you notice a `` '' p '' '' in the score , you need to play softer . ''
four p 's — extremely soft .
so it has a history of about 200 years .
i was born deaf , and i was taught to believe that sound was n't a part of my life .
and i believed it to be true .
yet , i realize now that that was n't the case at all .
sound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day .
as a deaf person living in a world of sound , it 's as if i was living in a foreign country , blindly following its rules , customs , behaviors and norms without ever questioning them .
so how is it that i understand sound ?
well , i watch how people behave and respond to sound .
you people are like my loudspeakers , and amplify sound .
i learn and mirror that behavior .
thus i 've learned , for example ...
`` `` do n't make too much noise when you 're eating from the potato-chip bag ! '' ''
i 'm hyper-vigilant around sound .
and i 'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound , about what 's to come next .
tbd , to be decided .
tbc , to be continued .
tba , to be announced .
in deaf culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
`` this is a sign for `` '' staff '' '' in asl . ''
yet for me , signing it with my thumb sticking up like that does n't feel natural .
in the year 2008 , i had the opportunity to travel to berlin , germany , for an artist residency there .
prior to this time , i had been working as a painter .
at that time , sound was trending , and this struck me ...
there was no visual art , everything was auditory .
now sound has come into my art territory .
is it going to further distance me from art ?
i realized that does n't have to be the case at all .
i actually know sound .
it could be felt tactually , or experienced as a visual , or even as an idea .
so i decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice .
and everything that i had been taught regarding sound , i decided to do away with and unlearn .
i started creating a new body of work .
and when i presented this to the art community , i was blown away with the amount of support and attention i received .
i realized : sound is like money , power , control — social currency .
in the back of my mind , i 've always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person 's thing .
and sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork , or it could empower me .
i chose to be empowered .
there 's a massive culture around spoken language .
and just because i do n't use my literal voice to communicate , in society 's eyes it 's as if i do n't have a voice at all .
so i need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice .
and that way , i 'm able to maintain relevancy in society today .
so at school , at work and institutions , i work with many different asl interpreters .
and their voice becomes my voice and identity .
they help me to be heard .
and their voices hold value and currency .
so with sound as my new art medium , i delved into the world of music .
and i was surprised to see the similarities between music and asl .
for example , a musical note can not be fully captured and expressed on paper .
and the same holds true for a concept in asl .
asl is broken down into many different grammatical parameters .
however , asl is more like a chord — all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in asl .
if just one of those keys were to change the chord , it would create a completely different meaning .
in asl , by playing around with these different grammatical parameters , you can express different ideas .
for example , take the sign to-look-at .
this is the sign to-look-at .
i 'm looking at you .
uh-oh .
what are you looking at ?
aw , stop .
if i was to create a sign and repeat it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music .
`` for example , this is the sign for `` '' day , '' '' as the sun rises and sets . ''
all ... day .
this is all-night , represented in this drawing .
we have the staff across the head and the chest .
everybody , hands up .
yes , got it .
`` that means `` '' to fall in love '' '' in international [ sign ] . ''
the second one i 'd like to demonstrate is this — please follow along with me again .
and now this .
`` this is `` '' colonization '' '' in asl . ''
and again .
`` this is `` '' enlightenment '' '' in asl . ''
so let 's do all three together .
`` `` fall in love , '' `` colonization '' and `` '' enlightenment . '' '' good job , everyone . ''
however , in this day and age , we live in a very audio-centric world .
we need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow asl to develop its own form of currency — without sound .
and this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society .
and maybe people will understand that you do n't need to be deaf to learn asl , nor do you have to be hearing to learn music .
asl is such a rich treasure that i 'd like you to have the same experience .
and i 'd like to invite you to open your ears , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our visual language .
and you never know , you might just fall in love with us .
( applause ) thank you .
it 's a piece of plastic with a radio shack antenna attached to it .
but then the great famine began in 1994 .
i was four years old .
my sister and i would go searching for firewood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after midnight .
i would wander the streets searching for food , and i remember seeing a small child tied to a mother 's back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
hunger is humiliation . hunger is hopelessness .
for a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
on my ninth birthday , my parents could n't give me any food to eat .
but even as a child , i could feel the heaviness in their hearts .
over a million north koreans died of starvation in that time , and in 2003 , when i was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
i saw my father wither away and die .
in the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to china to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
since we had never been separated , and i thought we would be together forever , i did n't even give her a hug when she left .
it was the biggest mistake i have ever made in my life .
but again , i did n't know it was going to be a long goodbye .
i have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
suddenly , i became an orphan and homeless .
my daily life became very hard , but very simple .
my goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash .
but that is no way to survive .
i started to realize , begging would not be the solution .
so i started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
sometimes , i found small jobs in exchange for food .
once , i even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
i was not uncommon .
many other orphans survived this way , or worse .
when i could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , i hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
that hope kept me alive .
i do n't mean big , grand hope .
i mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread , even though it usually did n't .
but if i did n't believe it , i would n't even try , and then i would die .
hope kept me alive .
every day , i told myself , no matter how hard things got , still i must live .
after three years of waiting for my sister 's return , i decided to go to china to look for her myself .
i realized i could n't survive much longer this way .
i knew the journey would be risky , but i would be risking my life either way .
i could die of starvation like my father in north korea , or at least i could try for a better life by escaping to china .
i had learned that many people tried to cross the border to china in the nighttime to avoid being seen .
north korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
chinese soldiers will catch and send back north koreans , where they face severe punishment .
i decided to cross during the day , first because i was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because i knew i was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , i thought i might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
i made it to china on february 15 , 2006 .
i was 16 years old .
i thought things in china would be easier , since there was more food .
i thought more people would help me .
but it was harder than living in north korea , because i was not free .
i was always worried about being caught and sent back .
by a miracle , some months later , i met someone who was running an underground shelter for north koreans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years .
later that year , an activist helped me escape china and go to the united states as a refugee .
i went to america without knowing a word of english , yet my social worker told me that i had to go to high school .
even in north korea , i was an f student .
( laughter ) and i barely finished elementary school .
and i remember i fought in school more than once a day .
textbooks and the library were not my playground .
my father tried very hard to motivate me into studying , but it did n't work .
at one point , my father gave up on me .
`` he said , `` '' you 're not my son anymore . '' '' i was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply . ''
but nevertheless , my level of motivation still did n't change before he died .
so in america , it was kind of ridiculous that they said i should go to high school .
i did n't even go to middle school .
i decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
but one day , i came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
and during dinner , i wanted to have one more wing , but i realized there were not enough for everyone , so i decided against it .
when i looked down at my plate , i saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
i was so happy .
i looked at him sitting next to me .
he just looked back at me very warmly , but said no words .
suddenly i remembered my biological father .
my foster father 's small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was starving .
i felt so suffocated that i had so much food in america , yet my father died of starvation .
my only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night i also thought of what else i could do to honor him .
and my answer was to promise to myself that i would study hard and get the best education in america to honor his sacrifice .
i took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , i received an academic award for excellence , and made dean 's list from the first semester in high school .
( applause ) that chicken wing changed my life .
( laughter ) hope is personal . hope is something that no one can give to you .
you have to choose to believe in hope .
you have to make it yourself .
in north korea , i made it myself .
hope brought me to america .
but in america , i did n't know what to do , because i had this overwhelming freedom .
my foster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motivated me and gave me a purpose to live in america .
i did not come here by myself .
i had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
many people helped me along the way to get here .
north koreans are fighting hard to survive .
they have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they can not make it without help .
this is my message to you .
have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
my foster father did n't intend to change my life .
in the same way , you may also change someone 's life with even the smallest act of love .
a piece of bread can satisfy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
but i confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another joseph 's life and change thousands of other josephs who are still having hope to survive .
thank you .
( applause ) adrian hong : joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
i know you have n't seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
joseph kim : in korean ?
ah : you can do english , then korean as well .
( laughter ) jk : okay , i 'm not going to make it any longer in korean because i do n't think i can make it without tearing up .
nuna , it has been already 10 years that i haven’t seen you .
i just wanted to say that i miss you , and i love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
and i — oh , gosh .
i still have n't given up my hope to see you .
i will live my life happily and study hard until i see you , and i promise i will not cry again .
( laughter ) yes , i 'm just looking forward to seeing you , and if you ca n't find me , i will also look for you , and i hope to see you one day .
and can i also make a small message to my mom ?
ah : sure , please .
jk : i have n't spent much time with you , but i know that you still love me , and you probably still pray for me and think about me .
i just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
thank you .
( applause )
while you 're typing a captcha , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
we do n't tell you which one 's which , and we say , please type both .
so every time you buy tickets on ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
here 's another really bad one .
there are tens of thousands of these .
okay , so this is my favorite number of recaptcha .
so that 's what i would like to do .
now some of you may say , why ca n't we use computers to translate ?
the other problem you 're going to run into is a lack of motivation .
this is a sentence that was translated from german into english .
in oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named alice stewart .
and alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s .
and she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest fellow to be elected to the royal college of physicians .
she was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
and she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease .
but like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
the hard problem that alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families .
so , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ?
now , alice had trouble getting funding for her research .
in the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the lady tata memorial prize .
and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
now , she had no idea what to look for .
this really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
had they consumed colored drinks ?
did they eat fish and chips ?
did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
what time of life had they started school ?
and when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
by a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been x-rayed when pregnant .
now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold .
it flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the x-ray machine .
and it flew in the face of doctors ' idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they did n't harm them .
nevertheless , alice stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in the lancet in 1956 .
people got very excited , there was talk of the nobel prize , and alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
in fact , she need not have hurried .
it was fully 25 years before the british and medical — british and american medical establishments abandoned the practice of x-raying pregnant women .
the data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know .
a child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
openness alone ca n't drive change .
so for 25 years alice stewart had a very big fight on her hands .
so , how did she know that she was right ?
well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
she worked with a statistician named george kneale , and george was pretty much everything that alice was n't .
so , alice was very outgoing and sociable , and george was a recluse .
alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients .
george frankly preferred numbers to people .
but he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
`` he said , `` '' my job is to prove dr. stewart wrong . '' '' he actively sought disconfirmation . ''
different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
he saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that george could give alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
it 's a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who are n't echo chambers .
i wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators .
alice and george were very good at conflict .
they saw it as thinking .
so what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
that means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
that requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
and the more i 've thought about this , the more i think , really , that that 's a kind of love .
because you simply wo n't commit that kind of energy and time if you do n't really care .
and it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
alice 's daughter told me that every time alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
`` `` '' my mother , '' '' she said , `` '' my mother did n't enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . '' '' so it 's one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship . ''
but it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we 've experienced , mostly have n't come from individuals , they 've come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
so how do organizations think ?
well , for the most part , they do n't .
and that is n't because they do n't want to , it 's really because they ca n't .
and they ca n't because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
in surveys of european and american executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
eighty-five percent is a really big number .
it means that organizations mostly ca n't do what george and alice so triumphantly did .
they ca n't think together .
and it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
so how do we develop the skills that we need ?
because it does take skill and practice , too .
if we are n't going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
so , recently , i worked with an executive named joe , and joe worked for a medical device company .
and joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
he thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people .
he was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
but when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
so , he did n't really want to say anything .
after all , maybe they knew something he did n't .
maybe he 'd look stupid .
but he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
in the end , joe and i found a way for him to raise his concerns .
and what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
it turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts .
so now joe had allies . they could think together .
and yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle-blower , except that like almost all whistle-blowers , he was n't a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served .
but he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
and when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
and his colleagues do n't think of him as a crank .
they think of him as a leader .
so , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
well , the university of delft requires that its phd students have to submit five statements that they 're prepared to defend .
it does n't really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
i think it 's a fantastic system , but i think leaving it to phd candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
i think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
the fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we 've witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
it comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we ca n't handle , do n't want to handle , the conflict that it provokes .
but when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
but the truth wo n't set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
openness is n't the end .
it 's the beginning .
( applause )
my family ate one meal per day , at night .
only three swallows of nsima for each one of us .
so i went to a library .
i had never seen an airplane before .
whatever happens , do n't give up .
in the 1980s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the west could n't understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
if we take a look at what 's really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
we have three main groups .
we have online criminals .
like here , we have mr. dimitry golubov from the city of kiev in ukraine .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
we actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
here 's vladimir tsastsin form tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
this is stephen watt .
this is bjorn sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on and so on .
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , froze the swiss bank account of mr. sam jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million u.s. dollars on it when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
and i claim it 's already today that it 's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
and it 's very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
they 're motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
groups like anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
so those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
and then we look at cases like what happened in diginotar .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
diginotar is a certificate authority from the netherlands — or actually , it was .
it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the diginotar hack .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
well diginotar is a c.a .
they sell certificates .
what do you do with certificates ?
well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , ssl encrypted services , services like gmail .
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections , so the local government ca n't snoop on their discussions .
except they can if they hack into a foreign c.a .
and issue rogue certificates .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of diginotar .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
well in egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
`` among those papers , was this binder entitled `` '' finfisher . '' '' and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country . ''
they had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company headquarters are right here .
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called state trojan was found , which was a trojan used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
if you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it 's pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will tap your internet connection .
they will even use tools like state trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
`` now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , `` '' okay , that sounds bad , but that does n't really affect me because i 'm a legal citizen . ''
why should i worry ?
`` because i have nothing to hide . '' '' and this is an argument , which does n't make sense . ''
privacy is implied .
privacy is not up for discussion .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
it 's a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
we retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
it 's about enjoying mundane sounds .
this , for example , is my tumble dryer .
now sound is my passion , it 's my life .
( music ) ( applause ) ( music ) ( applause )
it 's often thought that there 's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
but i think this is quite clearly untrue .
so , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
and yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
ca : a lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
`` and i say `` '' thank you for being here '' '' because i was silent for 17 years . ''
because of the oil , everybody talked about the polllution .
well , that lasted 17 years .
i had a newspaper clipping .
`` `` '' oh , so you really want to go to school here ? ''
and in those two years , i graduated with my first degree — a bachelor’s degree .
two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
and i was the only one in the united states writing on oil spills .
my dad came out again .
i worked for the coastguard , was made a u.n. goodwill ambassador .
`` and i looked at him and i said , `` '' passport , huh ? ''
the road turned into the jungle .
because when i started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles .
i had no idea i would have a ph.d .
and so i realized that i had a responsibility to more than just me , and that i was going to have to change .
i was so used to that person that i didn’t want to stop .
( applause )
believe me or not , i come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate .
and the solution i offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
that culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where i have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from georgia tech in 1956 .
as an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .
`` after founding my company , interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in america for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , i read paul hawken 's book , `` the ecology of commerce , '' the summer of 1994 . ''
in his book , paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess .
and by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .
and i then challenged the people of interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the biosphere .
take nothing : do no harm .
`` i simply said , `` '' if hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ? ''
`` unless somebody leads , nobody will . '' '' it 's axiomatic . why not us ? ''
and thanks to the people of interface , i have become a recovering plunderer .
( laughter ) ( applause ) i once told a fortune magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
and that became the headline of a fortune article .
they went on to describe me as america 's greenest ceo .
from plunderer to recovering plunderer , to america 's greenest ceo in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on american ceos in 1999 .
`` asked later in the canadian documentary , `` '' the corporation , '' '' what i meant by the `` '' go to jail '' '' remark , i offered that theft is a crime . ''
and theft of our children 's future would someday be a crime .
but i realized , for that to be true — for theft of our children 's future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children 's future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator — in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
according to paul and anne ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , affluence and technology .
that is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced .
and though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .
so the equation is conceptual .
still it works to help us understand the problem .
so we set out at interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
paul and anne ehrlich 's environmental impact equation : i is equal to p times a times t : population , affluence and technology .
i wanted interface to rewrite that equation so that it read i equals p times a divided by t .
now , the mathematically-minded will see immediately that t in the numerator increases impact — a bad thing — but t in the denominator decreases impact .
`` so i ask , `` '' what would move t , technology , from the numerator — call it t1 — where it increases impact , to the denominator — call it t2 — where it reduces impact ? ''
i thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , t1 , as we practiced it at interface , and it had the following characteristics .
extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
linear : take , make , waste .
powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity .
more carpet per man-hour .
thinking it through , i realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator .
in the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
and i reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of t1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
and that became the interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
we have measured our progress very rigorously .
so i can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years .
net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage .
( applause ) over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .
so an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .
this is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption — so the scientists are telling us .
fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
the cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .
water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in california , city of industry , where water is so precious .
renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
we have diverted 148 million pounds — that 's 74,000 tons — of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation — independent third-party certified .
we call it cool carpet .
and it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits .
three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand flor , misspelled f-l-o-r .
you can point and click today at flor.com and have cool carpet delivered to your front door in five days .
it is practical , and pretty too .
( laughter ) ( applause ) we reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
we 've set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of mount sustainability .
we call this mission zero .
and this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found mission zero to be incredibly good for business .
a better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
here is the business case for sustainability .
from real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste — the first face of mount sustainability .
this has paid all the costs for the transformation of interface .
and this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
our products are the best they 've ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation .
our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .
you can not beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .
and the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
no amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill .
costs , products , people , marketplaces — what else is there ?
it is a better business model .
and here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .
there is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
but the marketplace was down 36 percent .
we literally gained market share .
we might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .
if every business were pursuing interface plans , would that solve all our problems ?
i do n't think so .
i remain troubled by the revised ehrlich equation , i equals p times a divided by t2 .
that a is a capital a , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
but what if we reframed ehrlich further ?
and what if we made a a lowercase 'a , ' suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
you know that would reframe civilization itself — ( applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the indefinite future .
but does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
well maybe so . but i do n't think so .
at interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
we can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
and now the challenge is in execution .
`` and as my good friend and adviser amory lovins says , `` if something exists , it must be possible . '' ''
( laughter ) if we can actually do it , it must be possible .
if we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
and if anybody can , it follows that everybody can .
hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here — frankly , an unacceptable risk .
who is that person ?
not you . not i .
but let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
and i myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
on a tuesday morning in march of 1996 , i was talking to people , as i did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether i was connecting .
but about five days later back in atlanta , i received an email from glenn thomas , one of my people in the california meeting .
he was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our tuesday morning together .
and when i read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .
because it told me , by god , one person got it .
here is what glenn wrote . and here is that person , most at risk .
`` please meet `` '' tomorrow 's child . '' '' `` `` without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , tomorrow 's child , though yet unborn , i met you first last tuesday morn . ''
a wise friend introduced us two .
and through his sobering point of view i saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
knowing you has changed my thinking .
for i never had an inkling that perhaps the things i do might someday , somehow threaten you .
tomorrow 's child , my daughter , son , i 'm afraid i 've just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known i should .
begin , i will .
`` the way the cost of what i squander , what is lost , if ever i forget that you will someday come and live here too . '' '' well , every day of my life since , `` '' tomorrow 's child '' '' has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which i presume to share with you . ''
we are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
the continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
and we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
for you , it 's your call .
thank you .
( applause )
