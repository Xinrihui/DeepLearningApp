# nmt_keras
While there are many char-level encoder-decoder models available, those are not meant for translation tasks. As in the words of keras team 
'Note that it is fairly unusual to
do character-level machine translation, as word-level
models are more common in this domain.'

This is a working keras model based on word embeddings.
